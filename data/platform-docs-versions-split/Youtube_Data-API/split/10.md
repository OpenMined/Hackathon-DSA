### I18nLanguages

An `**i18nLanguage**` resource identifies an application language that the YouTube website supports. The application language can also be referred to as a UI language. For the YouTube website, an application language could be automatically selected based on Google Account settings, browser language, or IP location. A user could also manually select the desired UI language from the YouTube site footer.  
  
Each `i18nLanguage` resource identifies a language code and a name. The language code can be used as the value of the `hl` parameter when calling API methods like `videoCategories.list` and `guideCategories.list`.
