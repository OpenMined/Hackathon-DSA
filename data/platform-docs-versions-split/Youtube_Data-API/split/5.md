### ChannelSections

A `**channelSection**` resource contains information about a set of videos that a channel has chosen to feature. For example, a section could feature a channel's latest uploads, most popular uploads, or videos from one or more playlists.  
  
Note that a channel's sections are only visible if the channel displays content in a browse view (rather than a feed view). To enable a channel to display content in a browse view, set the `[brandingSettings.channel.showBrowseView](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels#brandingSettings.channel.showBrowseView)` property to `true` for the specified channel.  
  
A channel can create a maximum of 10 shelves.
