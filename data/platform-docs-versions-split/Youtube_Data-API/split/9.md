### GuideCategories

A `**guideCategory**` resource identifies a category that YouTube algorithmically assigns based on a channel's content or other indicators, such as the channel's popularity. The list is similar to [video categories](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoCategories), with the difference being that a video's uploader can assign a video category but only YouTube can assign a channel category.

For more information about this resource, see its [resource representation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/guideCategories#resource) and list of [properties](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/guideCategories#properties).
