### PlaylistItems

A `**playlistItem**` resource identifies another resource, such as a video, that is included in a playlist. In addition, the `playlistItem` resource contains details about the included resource that pertain specifically to how that resource is used in that playlist.  
  
YouTube also uses a playlist to identify a channel's list of uploaded videos, with each `playlistItem` in that list representing one uploaded video. You can retrieve the playlist ID for that list from the `[channel resource](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels)` for a given channel. You can then use the `[playlistItems.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list)` method to the list.

For more information about this resource, see its [resource representation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems#resource) and list of [properties](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems#properties).
