### VideoAbuseReportReasons

A `**videoAbuseReportReason**` resource contains information about a reason that a video would be flagged for containing abusive content. When your application calls the `[videos.reportAbuse](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/reportAbuse)` method to report an abusive video, the request uses the information from a `videoAbuseReportReason` resource to identify the reason that the video is being reported.

For more information about this resource, see its [resource representation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoAbuseReportReasons#resource) and list of [properties](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoAbuseReportReasons#properties).
