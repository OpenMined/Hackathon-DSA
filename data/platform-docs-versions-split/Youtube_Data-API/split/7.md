### CommentThreads

A `**commentThread**` resource contains information about a YouTube comment thread, which comprises a top-level comment and replies, if any exist, to that comment. A `commentThread` resource can represent comments about either a video or a channel.  
  
Both the top-level comment and the replies are actually `[comment](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/comments)` resources nested inside the `commentThread` resource. The `commentThread` resource does not necessarily contain all replies to a comment, and you need to use the `[comments.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/comments/list)` method if you want to retrieve all replies for a particular comment. Also note that some comments do not have replies.

For more information about this resource, see its [resource representation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads#resource) and list of [properties](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads#properties).
