Please click to the left to expand this list and see more information on each parameter. See also the Google Photo Sphere spec for more info on the meaning of the params: https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata |
| `ProjectionType`<br><br>string | Accepted values include equirectangular (full spherical photo), cylindrical (panorama), and cubestrip (also known as cubemap, e.g. for synthetic or rendered content; stacked vertically with 6 faces).<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to equirectangular. This value should be equal to the actual width of the image, and together with FullPanoWidthPixels, it describes the horizontal FOV of content of the image: HorizontalFOV = 360 \* CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the horizontal FOV of the content of the image. HorizontalFOV = CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value will NOT be equal to the actual height of the image. Instead, together with FullPanoHeightPixels, it describes the vertical FOV of the image: VerticalFOV = 180 \* CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels / FullPanoHeightPixels. In other words, this value is equal to the CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the vertical FOV of the content of the image. VerticalFOV = CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>Required |
| `FullPanoWidthPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to equirectangular. This value defines a ratio of horizontal pixels to degrees in the space of the image, and in general the pixel to degree ratio in the scope of the metadata object. Concretely, PixelsPerDegree = FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. This is also equivalent to the circumference of the cylinder used to model this projection.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It only defines the pixel to degree ratio in the scope of the metadata object. It represents the number of pixels in 360 degrees, so pixels per degree is then given by: PixelsPerDegree = FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. As an example, if FullPanoWidthPixels were chosen to be 3600, we would have PixelsPerDegree = 3600 / 360 = 10. An image with a vertical field of view of 65 degrees would then have a CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value of 65 \* 10 = 650.<br><br>Required |
| `FullPanoHeightPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the FullPanoHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is always equal to FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is a second, redundant representation of PixelsPerDegree. FullPanoHeightPixels = 180 \* PixelsPerDegree. It must be consistent with FullPanoWidthPixels: FullPanoHeightPixels = FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaLeftPixels`<br><br>int64 | Default value: `0`<br><br>\--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the CroppedAreaLeftPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec. Concretely, AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec. AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels. |
| `CroppedAreaTopPixels`<br><br>int64 | Default value: `0`<br><br>\--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the CroppedAreaTopPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec. Concretely, AngularOffsetFromTopDegrees = CroppedAreaTopPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec.

See also the Google Photo Sphere spec for more info on the meaning of the params: https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata |
| `ProjectionType`<br><br>string | Accepted values include equirectangular (full spherical photo), cylindrical (panorama), and cubestrip (also known as cubemap, e.g. for synthetic or rendered content; stacked vertically with 6 faces).<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to equirectangular. This value should be equal to the actual width of the image, and together with FullPanoWidthPixels, it describes the horizontal FOV of content of the image: HorizontalFOV = 360 \* CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the horizontal FOV of the content of the image. HorizontalFOV = CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value will NOT be equal to the actual height of the image. Instead, together with FullPanoHeightPixels, it describes the vertical FOV of the image: VerticalFOV = 180 \* CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels / FullPanoHeightPixels. In other words, this value is equal to the CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the vertical FOV of the content of the image. VerticalFOV = CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>Required |
| `FullPanoWidthPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to equirectangular. This value defines a ratio of horizontal pixels to degrees in the space of the image, and in general the pixel to degree ratio in the scope of the metadata object. Concretely, PixelsPerDegree = FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. This is also equivalent to the circumference of the cylinder used to model this projection.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It only defines the pixel to degree ratio in the scope of the metadata object. It represents the number of pixels in 360 degrees, so pixels per degree is then given by: PixelsPerDegree = FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. As an example, if FullPanoWidthPixels were chosen to be 3600, we would have PixelsPerDegree = 3600 / 360 = 10. An image with a vertical field of view of 65 degrees would then have a CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value of 65 \* 10 = 650.<br><br>Required |
| `FullPanoHeightPixels`<br><br>int64 | \--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the FullPanoHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is always equal to FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is a second, redundant representation of PixelsPerDegree. FullPanoHeightPixels = 180 \* PixelsPerDegree. It must be consistent with FullPanoWidthPixels: FullPanoHeightPixels = FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.<br><br>Required |
| `CroppedAreaLeftPixels`<br><br>int64 | Default value: `0`<br><br>\--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the CroppedAreaLeftPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec. Concretely, AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.<br><br>\--- In cubestrip projection: This value has no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec. AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels / PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels. |
| `CroppedAreaTopPixels`<br><br>int64 | Default value: `0`<br><br>\--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere XMP Metadata spec.<br><br>\--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal to the CroppedAreaTopPixels value that this image would have, if it were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec.
