Content Library API client
--------------------------

You access the API through our Content Library API Client. The client runs on Jupyter, with which you can create a Jupyter notebook. Once created, you can import our Python3 or R Content Library API client module which allows you to perform queries against the API. See [Getting started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/quick-start).

The Content Library API Client allows you to access a variety of fields on the following data. Information and content from public entities listed below will be returned; however, certain data that could potentially identify users (such as tags) will be redacted or omitted in API responses.

* Facebook Page
* Facebook group
* Facebook event
* Facebook post
* Instagram business or creator account
* Instagram post

VPN
---

You access the API through our virtual private network (VPN) using OpenVPN. Follow the OpenVPN Setup instructions in [Getting started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/quick-start) to learn how to install and configure the OpenVPN client.

Data dictionary
---------------

We provide a detailed [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data) that describes the data names displayed in the Meta Content Library (the Name column) if applicable, and the corresponding API fields returned in Content Library API search responses (the API field column).

Meta Content Library
--------------------

[Meta Content Library](https://www.facebook.com/transparency-tools/content-library/dataset/1119037145491882/about/) is a web-based tool that allows researchers to explore and understand data across Facebook and Instagram by offering a comprehensive, visual, searchable collection of publicly available content—the same content that is also accessible through the Content Library API. The web-based user interface allows you to explore data, test out search parameters, and assess whether the resulting data is appropriate for your planned research. No knowledge of query or programming languages is needed.

Code examples
-------------

Code examples in this documentation use a tabbed code block with tabs for R and Python. Click the tab for the language of your choice to display the appropriate code. This is an example:

RPython

    Click the R tab to display R code here

Get access
==========

Meta is partnering with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan to vet applications and assist in onboarding to Meta Content Library and API.

Eligibility requirements
------------------------

To be eligible for product access, researchers must be affiliated with a qualified academic institution or a qualified research institution. Researchers from different disciplinary and professional backgrounds are welcome to apply.

For academic institutions, _qualified_ means the institution meets all of the following criteria. It is:

* Dedicated to the pursuit of education and research.
    
* Accredited, as indicated by recognized standards and evidence on the institution's website (such as a university), or as demonstrated by documentation provided to ICPSR.
    
* Qualified to grant academic degrees (such as undergraduate, graduate, doctoral).
    
* A not-for-profit endeavor (in other words, not a business whose sole purpose is to make a profit).
    

For research institutions, _qualified_ means the institution is a non-university organization, institute, or society/entity which operates as a not-for-profit entity and holds scientific or public interest research as a primary purpose or core activity.

Application and access process
------------------------------

### **Step 1: Review application requirements and submit an application.**

To help ensure a fair and independent application and evaluation process, Meta has partnered with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) based at the University of Michigan, to assess researcher qualifications and review submissions from global applicants. You can find an overview of the application process and data tools on ICPSR’s [Social Media Archive (SOMAR)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsocialmediaarchive.org%2Frecord%2F52&h=AT0KyzBuL2aAW1WoUa6RwmRz_UfUCxgrxNp5UnlYBy24dgv3Sr6ww3nL07tlsgPOTFZWoRq9EFToV3mLuQieWu8XtXJShgD0e28OOuf_onBsSoVRp71YjYKgExLnHLeaL17-xLgQXOXx5F6J). We also encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Meta Content Library [application page](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsomar.infoready4.com%2F%23freeformCompetitionDetail%2F1910793&h=AT17eH8PqUcMSMlLfLyk6eei5hVs06PnNXzNuCwUQQ4M-OZoQ31hXSxlMcoiEGLYLwmGCfiuXjaifkOjAsn5okGB7bZnl6bucB0omszuCI_hzvOXDCEn7lIUeOMiSgz2snphRbO-4eoE2onW) on the SOMAR site and [ICPSR’s application guide](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1iN4KOvFaYGZro23cB4j1FveouXMBcZnKl-yTUyx6fCg%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=AT354pmUnNUkPTnKD_5hW3BVvxDHWCwcM7s6U20g0BF9snQs_ai7N5gTD8mxL-LgQk483bGCNTVJxf7rx92EsvHXI2akjyqZGa6sYbTQQH0u8MEHkwYB2f3QPVsuQK8i-9wuDSXTuQsHmVOd) before applying.

ICPSR will notify Meta and the applicant if the application is approved. Researchers can expect the review process to take between four and six weeks.

### **Step 2: Fulfill additional data access requirements.**

The Meta Content Library API is available for researchers to access on ICPSR’s Virtual Data Enclave. A Data Use Agreement between ICPSR and your institution must be executed before you are granted access to the platform. More information about ICPSR’s requirements can be found in [ICPSR’s application guide](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1iN4KOvFaYGZro23cB4j1FveouXMBcZnKl-yTUyx6fCg%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=AT2-QNV0HxaBViTPLkqhiExeHo4UAw-3hwrwEt9bUFe16ZuKiDRfgX8BEkPI5_pofqwys0y3g9xWyVjv__QIxezg9RwmkhVadFWD8pvQyY9fiYwRQ6EQi5E_YoD6JYXHkVfAp8_SvSj8uQdo).

Meta will follow up with approved researchers with information on how to access and onboard to the Meta Content Library user interface (UI). The UI can be used separately or in conjunction with the Content Library API.

### **Step 3: Gain access.**

Access to Meta Content Library and Content Library API will be provisioned once all access requirements are fulfilled. In order to continue accessing the tools, you will need to recertify your affiliation with your institution and research project on an annual basis.

Import the Content Library API client
-------------------------------------

All calls are made using the Content Library API Client object. You only need to import the Content Library API client once per Jupyter notebook server session.

In code block examples in this documentation, select the R or Python tab to see the corresponding code. You can copy the code and paste it into your notebook.

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi) 
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version = "1")

Test with a basic search
------------------------

Test your setup by running a basic search query. Here's an example to try:

RPython

    # Create a search object
    my_page_search <- client$search_pages(
        q='mountains')
            
    #Instructions for display:        
    pages <- my_page_search$query_next_page()
    print(pages)

    # Create a search object
    my_page_search = client.search_pages(
        q='mountains')
    
    #Instructions for display:
    pages = my_page_search.query_next_page()
    print(pages)

Sample queries
--------------

### Search for Pages by keyword

To search for Pages that contain a specific keyword, create a search object using the `search_pages()` method with the `q` parameter. See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches are handled.

RPython

    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    # Create a search object:
    page_search <- client$search_pages(q='cybercrime')        
    
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:        
    print(page_search$query_next_page())

    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    # Create a search object:
    page_search = client.search_pages(q='cybercrime')
            
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:
    display(page_search.query_next_page())

This example would return only 10 results per page. You can keep calling `query_next_page()` to get the next page of 10 results, until all the search results have been returned. See [Search guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object) for other display and storage options.

### Request specific fields

To have the API return only specific fields on any Pages in the response, create a search object using the `search_pages()` method with the `fields` parameter and a comma-separated list of fields you want included. If omitted, default fields will be returned. To more easily see columns of data, this example specifies a DataFrame response format (the default response format is JSON).

RPython

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:
    page_search <- client$search_pages(q='cybercrime', fields='id,name,about')        
    
    # Specify DataFrame response format:       
    print(page_search$query_next_page('dataframe'))

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:
    page_search = client.search_pages(q='cybercrime', fields='id,name,about')
    
    # Specify DataFrame response format:        
    display(page_search.query_next_page('dataframe'))

DataFrame response format has clear columns:

Guide to Facebook events data
=============================

You can perform Facebook event searches by calling the Meta Content Library API client's `search_events()` method. This document describes the `search_events()` method and its syntax and parameters, and shows how to perform basic queries using the method.

All of the examples in this document assume you have already created a Python or R Jupyter notebook and have created a client object. See [Getting started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/quick-start) to learn more.

See [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data#dd-fb-event) for detailed information about the fields that are available on a Facebook event node.

Recurring events
----------------

Recurring events have a parent event to which all instances of the recurring event are associated by way of the `parent_event_id`. The set of fields returned for an event search differs depending on whether the event returned is a parent or an instance (child) of the recurring event. Start and end times, for example, are specific to instances of the recurring event. The following table summarizes the differences:

| Event type | Fields returned | Fields not returned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recurring event (the "parent" event) (event\_type=`recurring`) | `recurring_event_ids` | `attending_count`<br><br>`declined_count`<br><br>`interested_count`<br><br>`event_start_time`<br><br>`event_end_time`<br><br>`parent_event_id` |
| Instance of recurring (the "child" event) (event\_type=`instance_of_recurring`) | `attending_count`<br><br>`declined_count`<br><br>`interested_count`<br><br>`event_start_time`<br><br>`event_end_time`<br><br>`parent_event_id` | `recurring_event_ids` |

search\_events() method
-----------------------

This is the syntax of the `search_events()` method:

search\_events(

Sample queries
--------------

### Search for Facebook posts by keyword

To search for all public posts on Facebook Pages, groups, and events that contain specific keywords, create a search object using the `search_posts()` method with the `q` parameter. See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches are handled.

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi)
            
    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    # Create a search object:        
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q='cybercrime')
            
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:        
    print(post_search$query_next_page())

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    
    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    # Create a search object:
    post_search = client.search_posts(q="cybercrime")
            
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:
    display(post_search.query_next_page())

This example would return only 10 results per page. You can keep calling `query_next_page()` to get the next page of 10 results, until all the search results have been returned. See [Search guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object) for other display and storage options.

The API only returns posts from Facebook Pages, groups, or events that can be returned on their respective endpoints (`search_pages()`, `search_groups()`, `search_events()`).

### Request specific fields

To have the API return only specific fields on any Facebook posts in the response, create a search object using the `search_posts()` method with the `fields` parameter and a comma-separated list of fields you want included. If omitted, default fields will be returned. To more easily see columns of data, this example specifies a DataFrame response format (the default response format is JSON).

RPython

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q='cybercrime', fields='id,text,lang')        
    
    # Specify DataFrame response format:       
    print(post_search$query_next_page('dataframe'))

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:
    post_search = client.search_posts(q='cybercrime', fields='id,text,lang')
    
    # Specify DataFrame response format:        
    display(post_search.query_next_page('dataframe'))

DataFrame response format has clear columns:

### Search for Facebook posts containing a specific URL

To search for all public posts on Facebook Pages, groups, and events that contain specific keywords and a specific URL, create a search object using the `search_posts()` method with the `q` and `link` parameters. The `link` parameter cannot be used without the `q` parameter. See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches are handled.

All forms of the URL that point to the same piece of content will be returned. Searching for multiple URLs in one query is not supported.

RPython

    # Create a search object including both the `q` and `link` parameters:
            
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q="nike", link="nike.com")
    print(post_search$query_next_page('dataframe'))

    # Create a search object including both the `q` and `link` parameters:
            
    post_search = client.search_posts(q="nike", link="nike.com")
    display(post_search.query_next_page('dataframe'))

Guide to Instagram accounts data
================================

You can perform searches for Instagram creator and business accounts by calling the Meta Content Library API client's `search_ig_accounts()` method. This document describes the `search_ig_accounts()` method and its syntax and parameters, and shows how to perform basic queries using the method.

All of the examples in this document assume you have already created a Python or R Jupyter notebook and have created a client object. See [Getting started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/quick-start) to learn more.

See [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data#dd-ig-account) for detailed information about the fields that are available on an Instagram account node.

search\_ig\_accounts() method
-----------------------------

This is the syntax of the `search_ig_accounts()` method:

search\_ig\_accounts(
    q=Q,
    fields=FIELDS,
    account\_ids=ACCOUNT\_IDS,
    account\_type=ACCOUNT\_TYPE,
    is\_verified=IS\_VERIFIED,
    since=SINCE,
    until=UNTIL      
)

The following table describes the parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Q`  <br>_Optional_ | String | Keyword(s) to search Instagram accounts for. See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches with Boolean operators are handled. |
| `FIELDS`  <br>_Optional_ | List | A comma-separated list of Instagram account fields you want included in search results. See [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data) for descriptions of all available fields. |

See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches are handled.

RPython

    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    # Create a search object:
    ig_account_search <- client$search_ig_accounts(q='cybercrime')        
    
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:        
    print(ig_account_search$query_next_page())

    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:

    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:
    display(ig_account_search_search.query_next_page())

This example would return only 10 results per page. You can keep calling `query_next_page()` to get the next page of 10 results, until all the search results have been returned.

Sample Queries
--------------

### Search for Instagram posts by keyword

To search for all public posts from Instagram creator and business accounts that contain a specific keyword, create a search object using the `search_ig_posts()` method with the `q` parameter. See [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search) for information about how multiple keyword searches are handled.

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi)
            
    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    # Create a search object:        
    ig_post_search <- client$search_ig_posts(q='cybercrime')
            
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:        
    print(ig_post_search$query_next_page())

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    
    # Create a client object if you have not already done so:
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    # Create a search object:
    if_post_search = client.search_ig_posts(q="cybercrime")
            
    # No results are displayed until you provide display instructions:
    display(ig_post_search.query_next_page())

This example would return only 10 results per page. You can keep calling `query_next_page()` to get the next page of 10 results, until all the search results have been returned. See [Search guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object) for other display and storage options.

The API only returns posts from Instagram creator and business accounts that can be returned from the `search_ig_accounts` endpoint.

### Request specific fields

To have the API return only specific fields on any Instagram posts in the response, create a search object using the `search_ig_posts()` method with the `fields` parameter and a comma-separated list of fields you want included. If omitted, default fields will be returned. To more easily see columns of data, this example specifies a DataFrame response format (the default response format is JSON).

RPython

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:
    ig_post_search <- client$search_ig_posts(q='cybercrime', fields='id,text,creation_time')        
    
    # Specify DataFrame response format:       
    print(ig_post_search$query_next_page('dataframe'))

    # Create a search object including a list of fields:

Queries in Meta Content Library and API are powered by a version of Facebook’s [search engine infrastructure](https://research.facebook.com/publications/unicorn-a-system-for-searching-the-social-graph/), which relies on a combination of indexing and ranking to return relevant entities. The retrieval function combines matched and ranked IDs from a query using the same distributed [memory caching layer](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2013%2F06%2F25%2Fcore-data%2Ftao-the-power-of-the-graph%2F&h=AT1SLLepYDIP6L84J8yiqJcwUb8dbFPZdB5-TQjHzjHw0NJX70yDxBx1bC4s02RAcPtCHPSNb41KXSQLkBSOkWp6OjeTy6-BDn3bCLZ7V9TyKTDULyBNUx7trvZO89pGUkAw1o9WQWl0O-ML) which serves live platform content. This ensures that results represent the most current state of content on the platform and meet privacy-preserving visibility criteria (see [Frequently asked questions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/disclosures) for details).

As content is created or modified on Meta platforms, associated entities are registered to a search index built from individual words extracted from text fields as _tokens_. Tokenization generally isolates words separated by spaces or punctuation ( ?@$%^\*()+=~\[{}\];:"<>|. ), with some URL normalization and locale-specific adjustments for non-English languages. Tokenization is exact, in that it does not introduce additional word variants ("cats" will not be tokenized to "cat"). Direct mentions of users or other platform entities (via @) are not tokenized and are scrubbed from returned text fields, and are thus not searchable.

At query time, relevant content is identified by exact matching between tokens and individual search terms. Candidate matches are then subject to additional filtering via Boolean query logic (see [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search)) and other selected filters. Matching is performed independently by word in a query, meaning that searching by phrase is not supported (queries “All for one” and “One for all” are equivalent).

Search objects in the API
-------------------------

The Content Library API uses search objects to extract a subset of data from an extremely large online database. Each search object specifies the search method to be used and sets the values of the parameters that determine which data will be returned.

The parameters accepted by each search method are described in the search method [guides](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guides).

The following sections describe how to use search objects to achieve various objectives, providing query examples in both R and Python.

* [Basic synchronous search with paginated results](#sync-search)
    
* [Response formats](#res-formats)
    
* [Altering search parameters](#alter-search)
    
* [Asynchronous search](#async-search)
    
* [Estimating response size](#estimate)
    

### Basic synchronous search with paginated results

Unless you specify otherwise, a search object is synchronous in nature, meaning that you submit the query and wait for the results, and you cannot submit another until the first one finishes. Synchronous search results display 10 results at a time (a "page") and you request the next pages one by one. This type of search is most useful when the data matching the search criteria is expected to be small or when you just want to sample some results to see if they are appropriate for your research and don't necessarily need to see everything. This can be a step in the process of fine-tuning your search criteria.

Synchronous searches can return a maximum of 1000 results. When you need a larger set of results, use [asynchronous searches](#async-search).

RPython

    #Import the client library if you have not already done so:        
    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
    
    # Create a search object using the search_posts() search method:
    post_search <- client$search_posts(
        q='mountains',
        since=1622937600,
        until=1686095999)
            
    # Instructions for display:        
    posts <- post_search$query_next_page()
    print(posts)

    #Import the client library if you have not already done so:
    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    # Create a search object using the search_posts() search method:
    post_search = client.search_posts(
        q='mountains',
        since=1622937600,
        until=1686095999)
            
    #Instructions for display:        
    posts = post_search.query_next_page()
    print(posts)

### Response formats

By default, search responses use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. This response format uses separators rather than being organized into columns. If you prefer the display in columns, the API has a function to specify DataFrame format instead.

RPython

    # Create a search object
    post_search <- client$search_posts(
        q='mountains')
            
    # Instructions for display:        
    print(post_search$query_next_page('dataframe'))

    # Create a search object
    post_search = client.search_posts(
        q='mountains')
    
    #Instructions for display:
    
    display(post_search.query_next_page('dataframe'))

### Altering search parameters

While exploring the data to arrive at the most appropriate search parameters for your purposes, you might find the `alter_search_params` method useful. This method returns a new search object with any new parameters you specify overriding the original ones.

RPython

    # Get a new search object with altered parameters:
    new_post_search <- post_search$alter_search_params(q = 'mountains', lang='en,es', since=1622937600,
        until=1622938000)
    
    # Instructions for display:
    new_post <- new_post_search$query_next_page()
    print(new_post)

    # Get a new search object with altered parameters:
    new_post_search = post_search.alter_search_params(q = 'mountains', lang='en,es', since=1622937600,
        until=1622938000)
    
    # Instructions for display:
    new_post = new_post_search.query_next_page()
    print(new_post)

### Asynchronous search

Asynchronous searching capability is available for when you want to work with all of the data returned from a search, up to the search results limit that applies to every individual asynchronous search. Asynchronous searches can take some time (minutes to days) to complete because they return all of the data requested, not just one page at a time. However, because the search happens in the background, you don't have to wait for the results before submitting another search or doing other work. Once the search results are ready, you can fetch them.

The search result limit for each asynchronous search is 100,000 results. See [Estimating response size](#estimate).

Researcher Platform also has an asynchronous search feature, but that is strictly for static database use and does not work the same way. With Content Library API, you can only use the `async_search()` method described here.

When you submit an asynchronous search, the API returns "True" indicating the successful submission of the asynchronous query if the expected results are below the 100,000 search results limit, and an error message if the expected results are over the limit.

If the search is successfully submitted, you can check on the status and receive either IN\_PROGRESS or COMPLETE.

Use the `submit_async_query()` method with `async_status`:

RPython

    # Previous example submitted as an async search:
    async_submission <- new_post_search$submit_async_query()
    print(async_submission) # Returns True or error
    
    async_status <- new_post_search$get_async_search_status()
    print(async_status) # ex: # Returns IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETE

    # Previous example submitted as an async search:
    async_submission = new_post_search.submit_async_query()
    print(async_submission) # Returns "True" or an error
    
    async_status = new_post_search.get_async_search_status()
    print(async_status) # Returns IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETE

When the check for status shows COMPLETE, you can fetch the data in either JSON or DataFrame format (JSON is the default). You can also write the data to a file, which will be stored in the `/previous_searches/` folder in your Jupyter environment in JSON format.

RPython

    data <- new_post_search$get_data("dataframe") # Specifies DataFrame format
            
    new_post_search$write_data_to_file("file_name")  # Writes data to a file

    data = new_post_search.get_data("dataframe") # Specifies DataFrame format
            
    new_post_search.write_data_to_file("file_name") # Writes data to a file

Use the `get_all_async_queries()` method to get a list of all your previously executed asynchronous searches.

RPython

    # Get a list of search objects you've previously executed asynchronously:
    previous_searches <- client$get_all_async_queries()

    # Get a list of Search objects you've previously executed asynchronously:
    previous_searches = client.get_all_async_queries()
    print(previous_searches)

### Estimating response size

Use the `get_estimate()` function to get a rough idea of how much data would be returned from a search you have defined. Since the API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large. If the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed.

This is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the size of data that would be returned by any search.

RPython

    # Request an estimate:
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q = 'dogs')
    estimate <- post_search$get_estimate()
            
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

    # Request an estimate:  
    post_search = client.search_posts(q='dogs')
    estimate = post_search.get_estimate()
          
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

Advanced search guidelines
==========================

Meta Content Library and API have a search functionality that supports AND, OR, and NOT operators. Query strings are passed as the `q` parameter as in this example (select the tab for the language of your choice):

RPython

    response <- client$search_posts(q=“dogs | cats & pets”)

    response = client.search_posts(q=“dogs | cats & pets”)

General rules
-------------

The following general rules apply to forming queries:

* The following operators are supported: AND, OR, NOT.
* Use an ampersand character (&) or a blank space to indicate AND.
* Use a pipe character ( | ) to indicate OR.
* Use a hyphen character (-) to indicate NOT. The en-dash and em-dash characters are _not_ interpreted as substitutes for hyphen and are treated instead as keywords.
* For queries with multiple operators, NOT clauses are processed first, followed by AND, followed by OR. Imagine the terms grouped as if with parentheses.
* For clauses of equal precedence, there is a default left-to-right processing order.
* Grouping using parentheses is supported. Grouping can be used to modify the default processing order.
* You can use single-word keywords only (not phrases).
* Wild cards are not supported.
* Extra spaces around operators are ignored, so you can have them or not.

Because they have special meaning in the context of query syntax, the following characters cannot be used as keywords or embedded in keywords:

* & ampersand
* | pipe
* ‐ hyphen
* space
* ( open parenthesis
* ) close parenthesis

Using operators
---------------

The examples included here demonstrate the basic use of the AND, OR, and NOT operators.

| Search objective | How to write it | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find matches that include all of the provided search terms. | Use the AND operator expressed as an ampersand character (&) or a blank space. | cat&dog&allergy<br><br>cat dog allergy<br><br>cat&dog allergy<br><br>cat dog&allergy<br><br>  <br><br>Each match contains all three terms: “cat”, “dog”, and “allergy”. |
| Find matches that include at least one of the provided search terms. | Use the OR operator expressed as a pipe character (\|). | cat \| dog<br><br>cat\|dog<br><br>cat \|dog<br><br>cat\| dog<br><br>  <br><br>Each match contains “cat” or “dog”, and could contain both. |
| Find matches that include the provided search term, excluding a second term. | Use the NOT operator expressed as a hyphen character (-). | dog -puppy<br><br>dog-puppy<br><br>dog- puppy<br><br>dog - puppy<br><br>  <br><br>Each match contains “dog” but not “puppy”. Results containing both “dog” and “puppy” are excluded. |

Multiple operators
------------------

When multiple operators are included in a single query string, the operators are processed (parsed) in a specific order: NOT first, followed by AND, followed by OR. This is important to understand because it means the order in which you place the operators in your query might be different from the order in which they are parsed, which might or might not affect the results.

The examples in this section demonstrate the use of multiple operators in a single query.

| Search objective | How to write it | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find matches that include both of two search terms (AND clause), as well as matches that include a third term (OR clause). | Use both an AND clause and an OR clause. The AND clause is parsed first. | lemon lime \| grapefruit<br><br>grapefruit \| lemon lime<br><br>  <br><br>Results include matches containing both “lemon” and “lime”, plus those containing “grapefruit”. |
| Find:<br><br>1. Matches that contain one search term, excluding those containing a second term, and<br>    <br>2. Matches that contain a third term<br>    <br><br>**Note**: Some matches might meet both criteria 1 and 2, but to be included in the query results, the only requirement is to match at least one. | Use both a NOT clause and an OR clause. The NOT clause is parsed first. | fuyu \| persimmon - astringent<br><br>persimmon - astringent \| fuyu<br><br>  <br><br>Results include:<br><br>1. Matches containing “persimmon” but not “astringent” (imagine persimmon - astringent grouped as if in parentheses), and<br>    <br>2. Matches containing “fuyu”<br>    <br><br>Some matches might contain “persimmon” but not “astringent” and also contain “fuyu” (matching both 1 and 2 above), but this is not a requirement to be included in the query results.<br><br>  <br><br>**Note**: If you actually want to exclude “astringent” from “fuyu” as well, you could achieve that using grouping, a technique for customizing the order of precedence. See the next section on [Grouping](#grouping-section). |

Grouping
--------

You can use grouping with parentheses to influence the order in which clauses are parsed. Clauses enclosed in parentheses are parsed first, followed by operators outside of parentheses.

The examples shown here demonstrate how this works.

| Search objective | How to write it | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find matches that contain at least one of two search terms, excluding those that also contain a third term. | Use an OR clause enclosed in parentheses to ensure it is parsed first, followed by a NOT clause. Without the parentheses, the NOT clause would be parsed first. | (fuyu \| persimmon) - astringent<br><br>  <br><br>Results include matches containing either “fuyu” or “persimmon” (or both), but exclude those that also contain “astringent”. |
| Find matches that contain both of two search terms or at least one of two other search terms. Exclude from that list all results that also contain a fifth search term. | Use an AND clause in parentheses, and an OR clause in parentheses. Separate the two parenthetical clauses by an OR operator. Group those two groupings together. Finally, add the NOT clause.<br><br>  <br><br>The extra grouping ensures that "outlaw" is not excluded only from the (newman \| redford) results, but also from the (action movie) results. | ((action movie) \| (newman \| redford)) - outlaw<br><br>  <br><br>Results:<br><br>* Include matches containing both “action” and “movie”<br>* Include matches containing either “newman” or “redford” (can contain both)<br>* Exclude matches that also contain “outlaw” |

Right-to-left languages
-----------------------

A few notes about queries when applied to languages that are read right to left:

* Query logic for right-to-left languages is parsed right to left
* The parsing order (NOT followed by AND followed by OR) is maintained
* Grouping is not supported for right-to-left languages

Rate limiting and query budgeting
=================================

Meta Content Library and API both have limits at the individual researcher level that:

* Put a cap on the number of queries allowed per user per minute (a separate limit for each tool). This is called a _rate limit_.
    
* Put a cap on the number of retrieved data records (posts, for example) per user per seven-day rolling window. This limit, called a _query budget_, is shared between the two tools per user. In other words, a single researcher has a total query budget between the two tools, regardless if they are using just Content Library, just Content Library API, or both.
    

Maintaining a rate-limiting and query-budgeting policy ensures that the tools run efficiently and provide all users with consistent data access, unhindered by reduced performance. It also provides a measure of protection against system flooding.

What are the limits?
--------------------

### Rate limits for Content Library

* 60 queries over any one-minute interval

### Rate limits for Content Library API

* Synchronous search queries: 60 queries over any one-minute interval
    
* Asynchronous search queries: 1 query per minute
    

See [Search guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object) for information about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous searches.

### Combined query budget per researcher

For Content Library and API combined, you can retrieve a maximum of 500,000 data records per seven-day rolling window. The rolling window is one week previous to the current timestamp (to the second). If you are blocked by hitting the query budget, you should not need to wait long before you try again.

How to request a limit increase
-------------------------------

If you have questions or concerns about the impact of your limits on your research, contact us through [Direct Support](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-and-api/direct-support).

Limit reached messaging
-----------------------

### Content Library

Content Library warns you when you get close to the maximum number of data records retrieved per seven-day rolling window (query budget) with a banner at the top of the page. This is an example of what the banner looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367743972_262423759986978_211809594479650483_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=NyFacTqBm88AX-0V5-Q&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-1.xx&oh=00_AfBQS_gjxe3ATK5fQqLkQnzHlRr6yyEtzhYDja2ufllKeA&oe=65AB92E4)

When you reach your query budget, you will see a different banner at the top of the page that looks like this:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367729115_698453068806558_1327188573085519935_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=KsMERTruSEcAX_WQqwL&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfBkvS2JAeTPDuXGcM1QL4pvJqdIMwjgxMoOH5drUrarIA&oe=65AAF529)

The banner has a "Learn more" link, which will open the following message with additional details about rate limits:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367733689_3623192734669772_7188247576546648393_n.png?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=icTD6FkFeAMAX9gL8Om&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfBebyOH5iYO9oXWyxHkUMpqfdL921RGFAwCbdLs37nqPw&oe=65AA8555)

### Content Library API

If you reach the maximum number of queries per minute (rate limit) in Content Library API, you will see a log message indicating that the system will retry your last request after a wait time.

This is an example of what the message looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/398010007_1547315062763139_1392026401103332627_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=SHQA3bQjeuMAX-r89vi&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfDb5pkzLwoIDXxGE5JpvZggNjwFR9ZRZtL1D35w6mJ0OQ&oe=65AAF385)  
  

If you reach the maximum number of data records retrieved per seven-day rolling window (query budget), you will see an error message indicating that you have reached your allotted query budget and recommending that you retry your latest query later. In this case, the system does not handle retrying the request for you.

This is an example of what the message looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/397449533_1025873445329811_6969197869066569786_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=yJf1WKglUr0AX-Fyqp6&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-2.xx&oh=00_AfAoGFZADcjm-MUwHcbtwieMOakzUqv19EB6Tj52MOOYiA&oe=65AB1A84)

Tips for staying below the limits
---------------------------------

In general, searching for common words and requesting to fetch all the results can exhaust your query budget. Consider narrowing your searches for more targeted results.

### Get your current usage

`get_query_budget()` is a method that displays your maximum number of data records retrieved per rolling 7-day period (query budget) and how much of that budget you have already used:

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    client$get_query_budget()

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    client.get_query_budget()

This is a sample of the output:

 
\[{'current\_usage': 101000,
  'preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries': 0,
  'total\_usage': 101000,
  'max\_usage\_limit': 500000,
  'timestamp': 'Tuesday, July 18, 2023 06:03:05 PM PDT'}\]

* _current\_usage_ is the number of results already returned by completed queries in the current 7-day rolling time window as of the current timestamp.
    
* _preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries_ is the number of results (rows) allocated for asynchronous queries that are in progress.
    
* _total\_usage_ is the sum of _current\_usage_ and _preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries_.
    
* _max\_usage\_limit_ is the maximum number of queries allowed in a 7-day rolling window.
    
* _timestamp_ marks the point in time at which these statistics were collected.
    

### Estimate response size for asynchronous queries

`get_estimate()` is a method that gives you a rough idea of how much data would be returned from a search you plan to run asynchronously. See [Estimating response size](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#estimate) and [Asynchrounous search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#async-search) in the _Search Guide_ for more information on these topics.

**Points to keep in mind**:

* The API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, so it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large.
    
* The query budget of 500,000 results in a rolling seven-day window can be used up quickly on just a few searches with high predicted results.
    

If the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, you might consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed or close to the response size you prefer.

This is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the number of results that would be returned by any search.

RPython

    # Request an estimate:
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q = 'dogs')
    estimate <- post_search$get_estimate()        
            
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

    # Request an estimate:  
    post_search = client.search_posts(q='dogs')        
    estimate = post_search.get_estimate()
          
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

* Synchronous search queries: 60 queries over any one-minute interval
    
* Asynchronous search queries: 1 query per minute
    

See [Search guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object) for information about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous searches.

### Combined query budget per researcher

For Content Library and API combined, you can retrieve a maximum of 500,000 data records per seven-day rolling window. The rolling window is one week previous to the current timestamp (to the second). If you are blocked by hitting the query budget, you should not need to wait long before you try again.

### Content Library

Content Library warns you when you get close to the maximum number of data records retrieved per seven-day rolling window (query budget) with a banner at the top of the page. This is an example of what the banner looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367743972_262423759986978_211809594479650483_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=NyFacTqBm88AX-0V5-Q&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-1.xx&oh=00_AfBQS_gjxe3ATK5fQqLkQnzHlRr6yyEtzhYDja2ufllKeA&oe=65AB92E4)

When you reach your query budget, you will see a different banner at the top of the page that looks like this:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367729115_698453068806558_1327188573085519935_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=KsMERTruSEcAX_WQqwL&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfBkvS2JAeTPDuXGcM1QL4pvJqdIMwjgxMoOH5drUrarIA&oe=65AAF529)

The banner has a "Learn more" link, which will open the following message with additional details about rate limits:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/367733689_3623192734669772_7188247576546648393_n.png?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=icTD6FkFeAMAX9gL8Om&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfBebyOH5iYO9oXWyxHkUMpqfdL921RGFAwCbdLs37nqPw&oe=65AA8555)

### Content Library API

If you reach the maximum number of queries per minute (rate limit) in Content Library API, you will see a log message indicating that the system will retry your last request after a wait time.

This is an example of what the message looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/398010007_1547315062763139_1392026401103332627_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=SHQA3bQjeuMAX-r89vi&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&oh=00_AfDb5pkzLwoIDXxGE5JpvZggNjwFR9ZRZtL1D35w6mJ0OQ&oe=65AAF385)  
  

If you reach the maximum number of data records retrieved per seven-day rolling window (query budget), you will see an error message indicating that you have reached your allotted query budget and recommending that you retry your latest query later. In this case, the system does not handle retrying the request for you.

This is an example of what the message looks like:

![](https://scontent-cdg4-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/397449533_1025873445329811_6969197869066569786_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=yJf1WKglUr0AX-Fyqp6&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-2.xx&oh=00_AfAoGFZADcjm-MUwHcbtwieMOakzUqv19EB6Tj52MOOYiA&oe=65AB1A84)

Tips for staying below the limits
---------------------------------

In general, searching for common words and requesting to fetch all the results can exhaust your query budget. Consider narrowing your searches for more targeted results.

### Get your current usage

`get_query_budget()` is a method that displays your maximum number of data records retrieved per rolling 7-day period (query budget) and how much of that budget you have already used:

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    client$get_query_budget()

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    client.get_query_budget()

This is a sample of the output:

 
\[{'current\_usage': 101000,
  'preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries': 0,
  'total\_usage': 101000,
  'max\_usage\_limit': 500000,
  'timestamp': 'Tuesday, July 18, 2023 06:03:05 PM PDT'}\]

* _current\_usage_ is the number of results already returned by completed queries in the current 7-day rolling time window as of the current timestamp.
    
* _preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries_ is the number of results (rows) allocated for asynchronous queries that are in progress.
    
* _total\_usage_ is the sum of _current\_usage_ and _preallocated\_rows\_for\_running\_queries_.
    
* _max\_usage\_limit_ is the maximum number of queries allowed in a 7-day rolling window.
    
* _timestamp_ marks the point in time at which these statistics were collected.
    

### Estimate response size for asynchronous queries

`get_estimate()` is a method that gives you a rough idea of how much data would be returned from a search you plan to run asynchronously. See [Estimating response size](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#estimate) and [Asynchrounous search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#async-search) in the _Search Guide_ for more information on these topics.

**Points to keep in mind**:

* The API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, so it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large.
    
* The query budget of 500,000 results in a rolling seven-day window can be used up quickly on just a few searches with high predicted results.
    

If the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, you might consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed or close to the response size you prefer.

This is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the number of results that would be returned by any search.

RPython

    # Request an estimate:
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q = 'dogs')
    estimate <- post_search$get_estimate()        
            
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

    # Request an estimate:  
    post_search = client.search_posts(q='dogs')        
    estimate = post_search.get_estimate()
          
    # Display the estimate:        
    print(estimate)

Data deletion
=============

Researcher Platform JupyterHub environment programmatically deletes all Meta Content Library API research output data and generated local files from JupyterHub environments every 30 days. This ensures that updates made to the visibility of content on Facebook or Instagram are carried over to Researcher Platform in accordance with Meta data deletion policies.

The data deletion is carried out during a 24-hour maintenance window the first day of every month beginning at 12:00 AM PST and ending at 11:59 PM PST on the same day, during which you cannot log in to your JupyterHub environment.

What is and is not deleted
--------------------------

The following forms of data are deleted:

* All output cells in notebook files
* All non-notebook files on researchers' persistent storage
* All S3 bucket files including uploads carried out from within the JupyterHub environment, asynchronous query output, and all query results

The following forms of data are _not_ deleted:

* Notebook files (.ipyhb files)
* Notebook input cells (code and markdown)
* Graphics in notebook cells

The maintenance window
----------------------

The maintenance window, during which you will be unable to log into your JupyterHub environment, begins on the first day of every month at 12:00 AM PST. It lasts for 24 hours and ends at 11:59 PM PST on the same day.

When the maintenance window begins, this message is displayed in JupyterHub and remains until the window ends:

Managing your data to avoid research disruption
-----------------------------------------------

To minimize the disruption to your research, consider taking the following measures:

* Since your input query cells are not affected by the data deletion, you can plan to rerun your queries and regenerate new outputs every 30 days. The output will not match exactly what you had previously because it will not include any user data that no longer meets visibility requirements for Content Library API.
    
* You can plan ahead to accommodate the maintenance window each month, so you are not caught by surprise, unable to work.
    
* You can plan to perform analysis on query results before a maintenance window occurs. Although the raw data is affected by the data deletion, your code, figures, tables, graphs and statistics from your analyses are not.

![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1754628768090156&ev=PageView&noscript=1)

Field expansion
===============

There are a number of fields in the data available through the Meta Content Library API that are nested. For example, the `statistics` field contains the `like_count`, `haha_count`, and several other fields. When you create search objects, you might want to include some or all of the nested fields in your search. _Field expansion_ allows you to perform queries for multiple fields and their nested fields in a single call. We refer to the nested fields as _expanded fields_.

In the [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data), expanded fields are indicated by a dot notation. For example, `statistics.like_count` indicates that `like_count` is available within `statistics`. To specify expanded fields in your search objects, you can either use this dot notation or you can append the names of the expanded fields in curly braces after the parent field. See the examples in this section.

Specifying multiple fields
--------------------------

You can specify which multiple fields you want returned on any associated data by using the `fields` parameter, with the field names separated by commas.

RPython

    library(contentlibraryapi)
    client <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='1')
            
    post_search <- client$search_posts(q='cybercrime', fields="id,text")
    post_search$query_next_page()

    from contentlibraryapi import ContentLibraryAPIClient
    client = ContentLibraryAPIClient.get_instance(version='1')
    
    
    post_search = client.search_posts(q="cybercrime", fields="id,text")
    display(post_search.query_next_page())

Specifying expanded fields
--------------------------

You can specify which expanded fields you want returned on any associated data by using the dot notation in your query to specify first the parent field, then the expanded field (such as `statistics.haha_count`).

RPython

    post_search <- client$search_posts(q='cybercrime', fields="id,statistics.like_count,statistics.haha_count")
    post_search$query_next_page()

    post_search = client.search_posts(q="cybercrime", fields="id,statistics.like_count,statistics.haha_count")
    display(post_search.query_next_page())

Alternatively, you can append a comma-separated list of expanded field names wrapped in curly braces to the end of any parent field name.

RPython

    post_search <- client$search_posts(q='cybercrime', fields="id,statistics{like_count,haha_count}")
    post_search$query_next_page()

    post_search = client.search_posts(q="cybercrime", fields="id,statistics{like_count,haha_count}")
    display(post_search.query_next_page())

If you specify a field but do not specify any of its expanded fields, default expanded fields on the associated node are included in the response. If you omit the `fields` parameter altogether, default expanded fields on default parent fields on the associated data are included in the response.

Search quality approach
=======================

This document describes Meta's approach to search quality for Meta Content Library and API.

Definitions
-----------

* **Entities** Objects in the social graph returned by Meta Content Library and Meta Content Library API which generate or contain content and are associated with a unique ID in internal systems. Includes Facebook Pages, groups, events and posts, as well as Instagram accounts and posts.
    
* **Content** Text and other data associated with entities, returned as fields in Meta Content Library and API.
    
* **Eligible / Visible** Entities or content permitted to be returned in Meta Content Library and API which meet privacy commitments and legal requirements. See [Frequently asked questions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library/disclosures) for details.
    
* **Endpoint** Meta Content Library or API endpoint corresponding to a specific type of entity.
    

Search overview
---------------

Queries in Meta Content Library and API are powered by a version of Facebook’s [search engine infrastructure](https://research.facebook.com/publications/unicorn-a-system-for-searching-the-social-graph/), which relies on a combination of indexing and ranking to return relevant entities. The retrieval function combines matched and ranked IDs from a query using the same distributed [memory caching layer](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2013%2F06%2F25%2Fcore-data%2Ftao-the-power-of-the-graph%2F&h=AT2DHB2nO6HbxTtKHlL2D9QseuP4TtMzr-xGQqvVAkag-wpqH1yV3Daoeq2sqDwAzSFXtEsM9A9uibknQ65elF2pFxy5zICvYYKNd4XRS4xfFUgMIe8qUhgt0DEQ2lk5qGp-CaM3TTLAEf0k) which serves live platform content. This ensures that results represent the most current state of content on the platform and meet privacy-preserving visibility criteria (see [Frequently asked questions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/disclosures) for details).

As content is created or modified on Meta platforms, associated entities are registered to a search index built from individual words extracted from text fields as _tokens_. Tokenization generally isolates words separated by spaces or punctuation ( ?@$%^\*()+=~\[{}\];:"<>|. ), with some URL normalization and locale-specific adjustments for non-English languages. Tokenization is exact, in that it does not introduce additional word variants ("cats" will not be tokenized to "cat"). Direct mentions of users or other platform entities (via @) are not tokenized and are scrubbed from returned text fields, and are thus not searchable.

At query time, relevant content is identified by exact matching between tokens and individual search terms. Candidate matches are then subject to additional filtering via Boolean query logic (see [Advanced search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search)) and other selected filters. Matching is performed independently by word in a query, meaning that searching by phrase is not supported (queries “All for one” and “One for all” are equivalent).

Initial testing
---------------

We expect our methodology to measure search quality to evolve over time. Here we outline a set of initial tests of search quality in the Meta Content Library and API. The systems which underlie search are complex and the data models as well as privacy rules which determine content visibility evolve over time, meaning that quality regressions can occur. Furthermore, as we develop the product, we welcome feedback about bugs or unexpected behavior from the user community. See [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details on reporting issues.

### Methods

#### Initial test queries

We generated test search results for each endpoint (Facebook Pages, groups, events, and posts, and Instagram business and creator accounts, and posts) using a sample of 130 terms chosen to span a breadth of set size (for example, obscure words such as _stopthesteal_ and common words such as _spray_), polarization (for example, neutral words such as _sugar_ and socially charged words such as _transphobic_), as well as most queried keywords by researchers in Meta platforms. These initial test queries consisted of single terms all in English without non-Latin characters or any symbols (for example ‘, #, $ or @). Additional query parameters for each endpoint are listed in [Test search scope for endpoints](#scope). Test queries resulting in > 100,000 results were excluded from further analysis.

#### Validation data

Lists of expected entities for test queries were generated from regex-based full-text searches on a SQL-like database backend. Tables in this database are built from periodic snapshots of logged platform content and thus are known to differ slightly from what is available in Meta Content Library and API at search time due to time lags and incomplete visibility filters. This dataset thus constitutes a secondary validation channel rather than source of truth and regressions in quality metrics may be a composite of both true indexing errors and/or measurement noise. See [Caveats and known limitations](#caveats).

### Recall

In principle, entities should be returned when (a) there is an exact match with search term(s), (b) the content is eligible to be retrieved, and (c) the total corpus of matching results does not exceed the technical query limit of 100,000 results.

We measured recall as follows:

(entities returned) ∩ (entities expected) / (entities expected)

The following table shows the average of daily recall values across test queries from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

| Endpoint | 20th percentile recall | Median |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facebook Page | 96% | 98% |
| Facebook group | 93% | 96% |
| Facebook event | 90% | 93% |
| Facebook post | 85% | 92% |
| Instagram account | 98% | 99% |
| Instagram post | 90% | 94% |

### Rank recall

Results which represent the _top N_ results ordered by creation time or views should also be complete. For Meta Content Library, which returns a truncated list of ranked results, we generated a _ranked_ version of recall which is calculated as follows:

(top N entities) ∩ (top N expected entities) / (top N expected entities)

The following table shows the average of daily recall values for the top 1000 results ranked by creation time and view across test queries from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

| Endpoint | 20th percentile ranked recall | Median ranked recall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facebook post (ranked by creation time) | 86% | 92% |
| Instagram post (ranked by creation time) | 64% | 75% |
| Facebook post (ranked by view) | 52% | 63% |
| Instagram post (ranked by view) | 62% | 73% |

### Precision

Only results which exactly match search terms should be returned, excluding, for instance, partial index matches (broom → broomstick) or fuzzy matches (broom → mop). Precision was measured as:

(returned entities matching query exactly) / (all returned entities)

The following table shows the range in average daily precision values across test queries by endpoint from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

| Endpoint | 20th percentile precision | Median precision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facebook Page | 99% | 99% |
| Facebook group | 99% | 99% |
| Facebook event | 99% | 99% |
| Facebook post | 99% | 99% |
| Instagram account | 97% | 98% |
| Instagram post | 98% | 99% |

### Representativeness

In cases where incomplete results are returned (recall < 100%), results may be useful provided they are not overly biased (that is, they are consistent with a random uniform sample of the complete results). We measured representativeness using a series of statistical tests for bias at the individual query level.

#### Query-level bias

For each test query we compared whether a summary statistic (mean, for example) calculated using the results from the Meta Content Library API reasonably approximated results obtained from the validation dataset (which has high recall). Across several data dimensions including engagement, exposure, and creator demographics, we performed a series of t-tests comparing means derived from the Meta Content Library API to means derived from the validation dataset. We then calculated the percent of queries which lacked statistically significant evidence of bias (p > 0.05). Finally, we calculated the mean of metrics across all dimensions.

We performed two versions of this test using methods which differed in their level of sensitivity to small differences between Meta Content Library API results and validation data. In the first version, we used a Welch’s T-test, which is appropriate for detecting major distributional differences between datasets that might affect inference about population-level traits. It is less sensitive to small differences between datasets and we expect most appropriate for research use cases involving trends and summaries.

The following table shows average daily percent of test queries generating non-biased results using a Welch’s T-test across endpoints from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

| Endpoint | Representativeness - Welch t-test |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook Page | 96% |
| Facebook group | 86% |
| Facebook event | 78% |
| Facebook post | 86% |
| Instagram account | 97% |
| Instagram post | 96% |

In the second version of the query-level bias test we compared Meta Content Library API and validation datasets using a pairwise t-test (incorporating covariance between samples). This test is more powered to detect differences between datasets and appropriate for assessing whether small subsets of entities may be missing or over-represented. For instance, this metric could highlight significant bias even with 98% recall and a negligible difference in means, due to any imbalance in the remaining data. Given known issues with the validation dataset failing to exclude some ineligible entities based on visibility criteria, we expect these measures to be more conservative and likely underestimates of representativeness.

The following table shows percent of test queries generating non-biased results using a paired t-test across endpoints from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

| Endpoint | Representativeness - paired t-test |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook Page | 80% |
| Facebook group | 54% |
| Facebook event | 41% |
| Facebook post | 53% |
| Instagram account | 74% |
| Instagram post | 64% |

Search quality measurement expansion
------------------------------------

While in initial testing we focused on English to measure the search quality, in our expansion, we extended the exact same methodology to other languages and advanced search (search with logic operators AND, OR and NOT).

### Other languages

We used the same methodology to measure the search quality of the queries in Arabic, German and Hindi. These languages were selected based on the language features that the team believe are most likely to impact search quality. The features that the team considered are diacritics (such as accents), non-Roman characters, and right-to-left. We also wanted to cover at least one non-English European language.

Based on the analysis, we learned:

* The overall search quality of all the new languages is about the same level as English single keywords.
    
* The precision is over 95% for all endpoints in new languages.
    
* Since the search quality is reasonable for these languages, we expect to see very similar results for most other languages too.
    

The following table shows all metric values across test queries by language and endpoint from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023. Representativeness is an average across all dimensions that are mentioned in the representativeness section.

| Language | Endpoint | Recall | Precision | Representativeness - paired t-test | Representativeness - Welch t-test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arabic | Facebook Page | 96% | 99% | 93% | 99% |
| Arabic | Facebook group | 92% | 99% | 41% | 61% |
| Arabic | Facebook event | 82% | 99% | 80% | 97% |
| Arabic | Facebook post | 91  | 99% | 70% | 94% |
| Arabic | Instagram account | 93% | 99% | 87% | 91% |
| Arabic | Instagram post | 80% | 99% | 85% | 97% |
| German | Facebook Page | 97% | 99% | 96% | 99% |
| German | Facebook group | 95% | 99% | 76% | 95% |
| German | Facebook event | 95% | 99% | 67% | 94% |
| German | Facebook post | 88  | 99% | 73% | 96% |
| German | Instagram account | 99% | 99% | 95% | 99% |
| German | Instagram post | 91% | 98% | 88% | 99% |
| Hindi | Facebook Page | 96% | 99% | 93% | 99% |
| Hindi | Facebook group | 96% | 99% | 39% | 61% |
| Hindi | Facebook event | 87% | 99% | 77% | 96% |
| Hindi | Facebook post | 92  | 99% | 71% | 95% |
| Hindi | Instagram account | 97% | 99% | 94% | 100% |
| Hindi | Instagram post | 73% | 99% | 80% | 96% |

We are also aware of a few limitations that our system has for other languages. The limitations are as follows:

* Meta Content Library API does not read any keywords with “ß” in German or semi-space (half-space) in Arabic.
    
* In Arabic, a word can be written with and without diacritics. Content Library API can only find the exact match for each form. Thus, if a researcher wants to find all posts related to that keyword, they have to search all forms of those keywords to get full results. For example, if a researcher need to find all post related to term مهاجر, they need to search مُهاجِر or مُهاجر or مهاجِر or مهاجر to get all the results.
    

### Advanced search

Advanced search includes searching keyword combinations with logic operators AND, OR and NOT. The following table shows all metric values across advanced search test queries by endpoint from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023. Representativeness is an average across all dimensions that are mentioned in the representativeness section.

| Entity type | Recall | Representativeness - Paired t-test | Representativeness - Welch t-test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Facebook Page | 95% | 77% | 94% |
| Facebook group | 93% | 71% | 93% |
| Facebook event | 90% | 59% | 83% |
| Facebook post | 83% | 70% | 93% |
| Instagram account | 98% | 79% | 99% |
| Instagram post | 78% | 83% | 99% |

Caveats and known limitations
-----------------------------

#### Why would results be inconsistent from one time point to another?

Inconsistencies between identical searches made at separate time points can be caused by entity visibility changes over time, which may be due to content being created, deleted or modified. There may also occasionally be short lags between when content is created or modified and when it is indexed.

#### Why am I not seeing an entity I can find on the platform?

Apart from coverage gaps or delivery issues mentioned below (see [Factors affecting recall](#recall)), it is possible the content is not eligible to be visible in the Meta Content Library and API. The visibility rules for content are complex and constantly evolving with new policies and regulations, making it possible that some content could be theoretically viewed by an individual on platform but not exposed via the Meta Content Library and API. For instance, visibility of some content is geographically restricted to users from the country where the content was produced. Also, direct mentions (via @) are not searchable, meaning that a result will not be returned if a matching term is only found in a direct mention.

#### Why would a search result not match my query?

Apart from tokenization issues listed below (see [Factors affecting precision](#precision)), it is possible that the content actually does contain the search terms, but they are found in different text fields or far apart within the text. Search matches query terms independently and scans all text fields visible from the UI. It also does not support phrase searching. Thus a search for “Walter Payton” could match a page listing basketball players “Walter Williams” and “Gary Payton” without reference to a “Walter Payton” anywhere in the text.

### Factors affecting recall

* False positives in the validation data (denominator of recall equation). In our tests, we have found that the validation dataset may occasionally include non-eligible entities for a given search term due to lags between real-time content visibility and privacy status and their representation in the databases used for validation (see validation data presented earlier). This means that true recall estimates are likely underestimated.
    
* Edge cases or gaps in coverage (true negatives). Indexing data at the scale which Meta operates means that occasionally some content may be imperfectly indexed or missed. Furthermore, internal data models may change, such as when new features for creating and sharing content on platform are added. Thus there may be a lag between when content is available on platform and when it is indexed. As we improve and scale the product, we appreciate any reported cases of missing data from search (see [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details).
    
* Asynchronous delivery issues. The Meta Content Library and API’s entity loading mechanisms are complex and memory-intensive at scale. Occasionally, the loading process for an entity can become too memory-intensive and fail, resulting in the exclusion of that entity from the returned results.
    

### Factors affecting precision

* String-matching used to validate precision is unable to approximate tokenization rules. Precision is checked using basic regular expression searches with strict definitions of word boundaries. However tokenization may be more flexible, especially with different language localizations, text involving unicode, URLs, and other patterns. The existence of these edge cases means that precision will be under-estimated to some extent.
    
* The search term was tokenized in a context-specific way. Occasionally words with unicode symbols, non-English characters, accent marks or URLs may be tokenized in a form that differs from its presented value. For instance, the content with the French word `congrégation` may be returned for a query on the English word `congregation`, despite the literal difference between the acute accented e and its English counterpart.
    
* The index has matched text not returned by the Meta Content Library or API. In some cases, content with complex, nested data models such as reshares may contain text fields that are tokenized and indexed but not returned by the Meta Content Library or API. We appreciate user feedback identifying such cases (see [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details).
    
* For the Facebook posts endpoint, there is a known issue involving post reshare text being indexed but not returned in the Meta Content Library API. These posts may either have no visible text (since they are reshares), or the text returned may not contain any mention of the query term. We are exploring this issue further.
    

### Factors affecting representativeness

* Representativeness issues generally stem from the same factors affecting recall. In these cases there is a population of entities which are either (a) not returned by the Meta Content Library API due to gaps in indexing / delivery, or (b) incorrectly included in the validation dataset adding noise to the calculation. If these groups of entities have similar properties along the data dimensions tested they can influence the representativeness metrics
    
* The per-query bias test uses a probabilistic statistical test which uses an alpha = 0.05 cutoff by convention. Thus for each test term there is a 5% probability that the test will be a false positive (Type I error rate).

Get API Code
============

Get API Code is a tool within Meta Content Library that automatically generates a Python or R code snippet corresponding to your current search that you can copy and paste into your Meta Content Library API Jupyter notebook.

**Remember the limits**

If you submit a synchronous query in the Content Library API that would return more than 1000 results, you will only see the top 1000.

If you submit an asynchronous query in the API that would return more than 100,000 results, the API will give you an error message and will not complete the query.

The automatically generated R or Python code might return more than 100,000 results. Be sure to check the very top of the Content Library search results to see the size of the results before you use the same search in the API.
