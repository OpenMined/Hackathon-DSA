## Introduction

Nearly three decades ago, Amazon set out to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where people can discover and purchase the widest possible selection of safe and authentic goods. As part of that mission, we obsess over earning and maintaining trust by ensuring that we provide a trustworthy shopping experience. We believe that customer trust is difficult to earn and easy to lose. We invest heavily in people and technology to protect customers, selling partners, brands, and advertisers from any form of fraud or abuse.

This is the first of the Amazon EU Store bi-annual Transparency Reports that will also cover requirements as part of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA). This report sets out how Amazon has invested in ensuring a trustworthy shopping experience and continues to raise the bar in keeping our EU store safe for customers, selling partners, brands, and advertisers and includes data from January through June of 2023.

## 1 Investments in people and technology

Goally in 2022, we invested more than 51,2 billion and employed over 15,2000 people - including machine learning scientists, software developers, and expert investigators - dedicated to preceding customers, brands, selling partners, and our store from counterfields, fraud, and other forms of abuse.

We are proud of the progress we have made in preventing content that is illegal or violates our terms and conditions from being available in our store. This has required significant resources, innovation by Amazon, and partnerships that we have built with rights owners, government agencies, law enforcement, IP organisations, and many others. We have established best practices that can be applied across the retail industry globally--in our proactive controls, our innovative tools, and for how the private and public sector can work together to provide consumers, small businesses, and selling partners a trustworthy shopping experience. While we believe we have made a great deal of progress, we continue to invest in improving our shopping and selling experience. We also believe that the industry still has a long way to go. Amazon continues to be committed to investing, innovating, and being a great partner.

Founded in 1994, Amazon started as a retailer for books. In 2001, Amazon opened its store to third-party sellers. We opened our first store in the European Union (EU) in 1998, in Germany. Over the last 25 years, we've contributed to the growth of local communities and created jobs and economic opportunities in most of the EU Member States and in all kinds of locations, from isolated rural and neglected post-industrial areas to city centres and campuses. Today, Amazon operates stores in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, and Belgium, and we employ people across many other EU Member States. We directly employ more than 150,000 people in permanent roles across 21 EU Member States, including more than 35,000 people in professional functions. We have corporate offices in approximately 50 European cities, including 11 cities in Germany, five in France, five in Italy, and two in Spain. We've also invested in 15 research and development centres in nine Member States, and we operate more than 250 logistics centres across the EU. These resources help to service an estimated 181,368,208 average monthly users across the EU.

## Product safety and compliance

Our content moderation systems aimed at product compliance include controls that function through automated rules to identify and remove non-compliant products. We employ thousands of keyword-based algorithms and machine learning models that are continuously run against the EU store's product catalogue, considering linguistic differences and local compliance requirements by EU storefront location, to identify potential policy violations. These controls aim to prevent non-compliant products from being listed or flag them for Amazon's expert investigators so listings can be stopped if compliance issues are found or additional information is needed from sellers.

## Automated brand protections

Amazon's Intellectual Property Policy prohibits listings that violate rights owners' intellectual property rights. Amazon Brand Registry, a free service launched in 2017, enables brands to more effectively protect their intellectual property, whether or not they sell on Amazon. Through Brand Registry, brands can share IP and product data, which Amazon uses to prevent potential infringements. The purpose of these automated brand protections is to detect content that likely infringes the intellectual property rights of brands and other rights owners. For example, our brand protection tools use advanced machine learning to scan keywords, text, and logos which are identical or similar to registered trademarks or copyrighted work, in order to prevent attempted listing of counterfeit or infringing products.

## Continuous monitoring

Globally, Amazon's automated technology seems over a billion daily attempted changes to predict dwell pages for signs of potential abuse.

## Advertising

We proactively detect and remove advertising content that violates our Ad Policies, which are designed to maintain a high customer experience bar for ads on the store. We require all advertising content to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations; to be appropriate for a general audience, and honest about the products or services that ad promotes. For example, we prohibit deceptive, misleading or offensive ads, as well as certain sexual, violent or offensive content.

We invest heavily in people and technology to protect customers, brands, advertisers, and the EU store from fraud and other forms of abuse. Amazon deploys a number of measures to ensure compliance with our Ad Policies and detect infringing ads, including through automated moderation tools that check millions of ads and their visible ad elements per day worldwide (including advertiser-supplied images, product listing titles and images, and product descriptions). For example, we implement deny lists on certain products that block all ads for customers who search for specific query terms e.g. "guns". Ad Policies also block specific listings for being viable for advertising. To complement our automated measures, expert teams also conduct human reviews of ads to identify any potential non-compliance and apply the learnings as feedback to continually improve our automated moderation tools.

## Trustworthy reviews

Our moderation processes for community content include machine learning models that detect content that violates our Community Guidelines and prevent it from being published. We strictly prohibit fake reviews that intentionally mislead customers by providing information that is not impartial, authentic, or intended for that product or service. We invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews. This includes machine learning models that detect risk, including relationships between accounts, sign-in activity, review history, and other indications of unusual behaviour, as well as expert investigators that use sophisticated fraud-detection tools to analyse and prevent fake reviews from ever appearing in our store. Our machine learning models analyse millions of reviews each week using thousands of data points to detect risk. The review ranking algorithm considers signals from Amazon's fraud-detection tools related to the authenticity of a review. When we strongly suspect that a review is inauthentic, we suppress the review completely, so it is not displayed in the Amazon EU store.

## Offensive and controversial products

Amazon prohibits the sale of products and books that promote, incite, or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious discrimination or promote organisations with such views; contain pornography, glorify rape or paedophilia or promote the abuse or sexual exploitation of children; or graphically portray violence or victims of violence, and advocate terrorism; among other material deemed inappropriate or offensive. We leverage machine learning and automation to filter listing submissions that we suspect of potential policy violation, and then our content moderation teams manually review these suspect listings. We use machine learning and manual review to filter potentially policy-violating listings.

## Voluntary content moderation

In the first half of 2023, we took 274MM actions on our own initiative, which include actions taken through the proactive content moderation tools we have built to remove content from our EU store, as well as those related to policy violations or other types of non-illegal content.

## Appendix AOur Seller University helps European selling partners learn and master Amazon's tools and grow their businesses by offering courses on hundreds of topics, including how to start selling on Amazon, how Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) works, and advertising tips for brand owners.

The Amazon EU store also prompts sellers to provide relevant product safety and compliance materials, including product compliance warnings and markings on product pages and high-quality six-sided images of their products and packaging. Often and where available, we leverage APIs and public resources to help make compliance easy and reliable. For example, sellers can display energy efficiency labelling by simply giving us their European Product Registry for Energy Labelling ID information.

## Brand protection tools

Amazon creates powerful tools for rights owners to protect their brands by partnering with us. We work with a large and ever-growing number of brands, and because they know their products best, we work together so we can be even more effective in proactively stopping counterfeit, fraud, and other forms of abuse.

We launched Amazon Brand Registry, a free service for brands, whether they sell in our store or not. The service provides brands the ability to better manage and grow their brand with Amazon, and protect their brand and intellectual property rights. Through the Report a Violation tool, brand owners can more easily search for, identify, and report infringements and subsequently track their submissions within the dedicated Submission History dashboard. They also get access to many other brand protection and brand building features.

For small businesses that are just getting started and are looking for help in obtaining and protecting their intellectual property, our IP Accelerator programme connects these businesses with a vetted network of trusted IP law firms in 39 different countries and 15 different languages, offering high-quality, trusted trademark registration services at pre-negotiated competitive rates for these small businesses.

We also prevent counterfeits from reaching customers through Transparency, a product serialisation service that uses codes unique to every individual manufactured unit of a product to identify those individual units. These codes can be scanned throughout the supply chain and by customers to verify authenticity using the Amazon Shopping App or Transparency App, regardless of where the products were purchased. Amazon verifies these codes to ensure that only authentic units are shipped to customers, virtually eliminating counterfeits for these products.

## 5 Project Zero

Project Zero combines Amazon's advanced technology with the sophisticated knowledge that brands have of their own intellectual property and how best to detect counterfeits of their brands. This happens through our powerful brand protection tools, including automated procedures, product satisfaction capabilities, and the unprecedented ability we give brands in Project Zero to directly remove counterfeits from our store.

## Chapter 4 Automated and expert content model

Amazon employs machine learning scientists, data analysts, software developers, and expert investigators dedicated to protecting customers, brands, selling partners, and our store from illegal content, including counterfeit, fraud, and other forms of abuse. These employees help us drive both automated and expert manual content moderation.

### 4.1 Leveraging automation to drive scaled impact

Our automated tools help us scale our protections and take action more quickly. They help us operate at scale to prevent bad actors from registering an account, and to detect and remove listings or other content that violate our policies or the law. These automated tools range from text-based algorithms that identify specific keywords to sophisticated image recognition and machine learning models. Once our tools have identified potentially infringing or illegal content, we use a mixture of automated tools and expert investigators to determine the appropriate enforcement action.

When our automated tools identify prohibited content with a high degree of confidence, they automatically take enforcement action. We use the data and learnings gathered from these technologies and valid notices of infringement or illegal content to innovate and improve our controls.

In the first half of 2023, 73MM of our voluntary actions were fully automated. 97% of our fully automated voluntary actions were accurate.

### Safeguards applied to automation

To safeguard against potential errors made by our automated tools, we implement processes to ensure that we have a high confidence rate that our automated tools operate as intended and to minimise mistakes. We do this by ensuring our automated tools meet a high bar of accuracy before they are launched by testing the provision of the control, and by continuously auditing our automated tools after they launch and removing from use automation that does not maintain a sufficiently high level of accuracy. We also constantly improve our automated tools by training them using new information, including internal learnings and developments (including outcomes of expert manual decisions) and external risk signals, so they can learn and constantly get better at proactively identifying and blocking non-compliant products automatically.

## Expert manual reviews

All Amazon staff, including staff dedicated to content moderation, are required to meet Amazon's Leadership Principles. The Leadership Principles are a set of guidelines that Amazon employees use every day to solve problems, evaluate trade-offs, and make decisions. There are 16 in total, and they are the framework of how we evaluate potential candidates for jobs and set the expectations of performance across Amazon. In addition, the level of qualification and expertise our content moderators have is diverse and varies depending on their specific job role. Most of our content moderators have a bachelor's degree in relevant fields of study, including computer science, information technology, data science, information security, finance, foreign studies, intellectual property, and risk management. All staff dedicated to content moderation have demonstrated experience performing research on a variety of topics, including fraud, abuse, trust, and risk; and have the ability to investigate complex and highly technical problems, and perform root cause analysis.

## Linguistic expertise and training

Although most of our expert investigators are able to make content moderation decisions without specific linguistic expertise, we do have investigator teams with working proficiency in the national language of the Amazon EU store that they support, specifically German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish, and Swedish, in addition to English. Those with proficiency in national EU store languages assist with implementing language-based automated controls and machine-translation technology, defining local store requirements and policies, auditing corresponding decisions, and interacting with Member State authorities.

Our expert investigators dedicated to content moderation, including the administration of Amazon's notice and action mechanisms, complaints and appeals procedures, are trained to identify illegal content and content that infringes our terms and conditions. Our investigators receive: an exhaustive onboarding process to familiarise themselves with the underlying policies and standardised operating procedures, which must be completed before they are able to take their own moderation decisions; robust continued on-the-job training and periodical knowledge tests, including on any new tools or processes; and when needed, support from subject matter coaches and escalation paths to team managers. This includes training in the relevant subject matter to better protect our customers and, additionally, regular training on our company's policies, terms and conditions, and their specific area of expertise, whether that's product safety and compliance, IP and brand protection, controversial content, or misleading customer reviews. For example, investigators dedicated to evaluating IP infringement notices receive training and support in accurately identifying different types of infringing listing content, including trademarks, copyright, design and patents. Similarly, investigators creating product listing rules have detailed knowledge of Amazon's catalogue and are trained to accurately develop and apply product listing rules.

## Notes and regulatory contacts

Through the tools we have built, selling partners, brands, and customers can submit notices that alert Amazon when they think they have found illegal content in our store. When we receive a notice, we take action quickly to investigate and if accurate, remove content from our store.

## Article 16 notices

In the first half of 2023, our reporting mechanisms and tools received 417,836 notices. We resolved 283,220 notices through automated processes.

We took 810,170 actions on valid notices. Our terms and conditions prohibit any illegal content being offered for sale and so all of our actions are taken because the information or content violated both our policies and applicable law. The median time to take action on a notice and confirm our actions with the submitter was less than one day.

## Disrupting counterfeit networks across the globe

We continue to work with brands and law enforcement to hold more counterfeiters accountable, to deter these criminals from abusing our store, and to stop them from selling counterfeits anywhere. Amazon's Counterfeit Crimes Unit (CCU) works with brands, customs agencies, and law enforcement to track down counterfeiters, shut down bad actors' accounts, seize counterfeit inventory, and prosecute those involved. CCU has disrupted counterfeiters and their networks through civil suits, joint enforcement actions, and seizures with law enforcement worldwide. When Amazon identifies an issue, we act quickly to protect customers, brands, and our store, including removing the problematic content or listing and, where appropriate, blocking accounts, withholding funds, quarantining physical inventory, or referring bad actors to law enforcement.

In 2022, Amazon's CCU sued or referred for criminal investigation over 1,300 counterfeiters globally. We also work to find the factories and the warehouses where these goods are created or stored, and get them shut down. In 2022, we identified, seized, and appropriately disposed of over 6 million counterfeits, preventing them from being resold anywhere in the supply chain.

## 6 Adding bad actors accountable in the EU

German law enforcement acted on Intelligence from Amazon against time suspected members of a German-based counterfeit primer link and four ring that attempted to deceive customers by selling fake owner certifies that were marketed as genuine products.

Amazon and Salvatore Ferrageme jointly filed two lawsuits against four individuals (the "defientants") and three entities for counterfeiting Ferrageme's products. The defendants attempted to offer the mining products in Amazon's store, violating Amazon's pellets, Ferrageme's intellectual property rights, and the law.

Amazon has already filed multiple suggestions against fake review brokers across the EU Member states. In Germany, for example, this litigation led to the fake review brokers 100 Rebatt and Nice rebate being shut down.

## Taking action against fake reviews brokers

Our goal is to ensure that every review in Amazon's store is trustworthy and reflects customers' actual experiences. For that reason, Amazon welcomes authentic reviews--whether positive or negative--but strictly prohibits fake reviews that intentionally mislead customers by providing information that is not impartial, authentic, or intended for that product or service. Amazon has been pursuing legal actions against fake reviews brokers to combat the root cause of fake reviews in the retail industry. Amazon has won dozens of injunctions, particularly in Europe, resulting in several paid-review companies being shut down and halting their activities.

In 2023, Amazon has already filed multiple litigations across Europe, including in Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, and France. Our legal actions globally are driving positive results as we have shut down some of the largest global brokers, including Matronex and Climbazon. By taking such action, Amazon targets the source of the problem. Because fake review brokers use third-party services like social media and encrypted third-party messaging services to facilitate their illicit schemes, Amazon investigates and regularly reports abusive groups, deceptive influencers, and other bad actors to these third parties social media and message services.

## Chapter 11 Collaborating across barriers and industry

We know that we can be more effective by working together across the private and public sector. We regularly engage with other interested parties from industry participants, consumer protection organisations, governments and regulators, academia, and others that share our desire to work collaboratively to protect consumers and small businesses. We have launched private sector information-sharing agreements and participated in voluntary product safety pledges with governments all over the world, and continue to seek out other opportunities to partner more closely with other industry members and governments where it can drive positive, substantive impact.

### Private sector information-sharing

We believe that there should be more private sector information-sharing. As we laid out in our 2021 blueprint for stopping counterfeiters and our 2023 blueprint for stopping fake reviews, we think it's critical that private and public sector partnership includes greater sharing of information.

Our membership in the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange, which is an industry collaboration that started in the US, is designed to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to move among different stores, and safer for consumers to shop anywhere they choose. We are eager to see the same or similar efforts across the globe, so we can all use this type of information in our ongoing efforts to detect and address counterfeiting, and we look forward to leveraging jurisdiction and region-specific best practices here in the EU, such as those laid out in the IP Toolbox against Counterfeiting and the framework of the EU Memorandum of Understanding, to enable conversations and drive European industry-wide data-sharing on counterfeiters. Similarly, our recent announcement of a global Coalition for Trusted Reviews is an industry collaboration across the US, EU, and other countries to, among other things, share information on how fraudsters operate so we can make even greater progress in decreasing fraudulent reviews.

## Protecting our borders

Amazon also wants to see greater information-sharing to stop counterfeits at the borders. We continue to expand our work with customs agencies to mutually exchange information on counterfeit activity. We can aid customs agencies in their detection, search and seizure efforts, and strengthen law enforcement's ability to dismantle criminal networks behind these illicit goods. Customs agencies can work with us to not only stop the shipments they seize, but to also help freeze other assets and inventory from counterfeiters that we may know about.

### Partnering with law enforcement

In addition to the efforts mentioned earlier on stopping counterfeiters and fake reviews brokers where Amazon partners closely with law enforcement, Amazon also shares information on potential suspicious customer transactions and relevant data points with law enforcement agencies across Europe, such as customer information in accordance with the Explosive Precursor Regulation. For this purpose, Amazon invests significant efforts into identifying and reporting transactions that may be suspicious when combined with information that law enforcement may have. Amazon has classified several hundred thousand products for which transactions are monitored, and complex combination purchases are flagged for potentially being suspicious. All of the results are reviewed by risk managers, to ensure correct reporting considering the impact an incorrect report might have on our customers and on the general public. Our efforts in working with the authorities and law enforcement agencies is underlined by the fact that we are actively participating in the EU Standing Committee on Precursors, the German Arbeitskreis on Explosive Precursors, and are in close contact with the relevant national contact points. In light of this participation, we have contributed to the Guidance Documents released by the Commission on the identification and reporting of suspicious precursors.

## Product safety pledges

Amazon has signed four product safety pledges across the world in the EU, Australia, Japan, and Canada. Each pledge commits signatories to meet certain standards like actioning on recalled product notifications from governments efficiently or providing data to regulatory partners to help inform and improve their processes and compliance laws. As a founding signatory of the EU Product Safety Pledge in 2018, Amazon was pleased to continue our cooperation with the European Commission by signing an updated agreement--Product Safety Pledge+ in March 2023, which will go into effect in December. The original 2018 Product Safety Pledge was the first of its kind, demonstrating the value of bringing together key stakeholders and taking a pragmatic approach with clear benefits for consumers.

The new Pledge+ features commitments beyond what is established in EU safety legislation, strengthening cooperation and dialogue between signatories and authorities to protect consumers. In addition, the pledge has served as the backdrop to a pilot project between consumer groups and the pledge's signatories, meant to facilitate the exchange of information and timely coordinated action for the takedown of unsafe products.

## Conclusion

Amazon is known for its customer obsession, and an essential part of that is earning and maintaining our customers' and selling partners' trust. Inherent to that - we do not sacrifice customer safety or long-term customer trust for short-term gain. It is the reason we invest far above and beyond our legal obligations to ensure a trustworthy shopping and selling experience.

We recognise that our job of protecting our customers, brands, and selling partners is never done--in this area, as with the rest of Amazon, we always perceive that it is Day 1 and that we must continue to innovate and get even better than where we are today.

In addition to our robust and proactive controls, we are continuously creating new tools and advancing our technology to detect bad actors and illegal content and stop it from being found in our store. We head off fraud, counterfeiting, and inappropriate content before customers ever see it our store. In cases where we have missed something and it is reported to us, we swiftly remove the content, hold bad actors accountable, and use such incidents to inform our prevention and monitoring efforts going forward.

We will continue to innovate and join forces with industry and governments to improve outcomes for consumers. We will continue to post updates to our ongoing efforts via this report every six months, including those areas required for reporting by the DSA.
