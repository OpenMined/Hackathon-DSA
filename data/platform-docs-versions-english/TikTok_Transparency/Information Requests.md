### About this report**

TikTok is committed to responding to law enforcement requests for disclosure or preservation of user information while respecting the privacy and rights of its community members. All requests for information are carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Our [policies and procedures](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement?lang=en) define how TikTok will handle and respond to law enforcement requests and require TikTok to disclose or preserve user data only when a request is motivated by a valid legal proceeding or in an emergency. In exceptional emergency situations, TikTok will disclose users' personal data without legal process. This may occur when, in good faith, we have reason to believe that sharing information is necessary in the face of imminent risk of death or serious physical harm. To learn more about our policies and practices, please see our [Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines](https://support.tiktok.com/fr/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/law-enforcement-data-request-guidelines). The sections below provide details on the volume and types of requests for user information received and whether the data was disclosed or retained.

#### **Requests for user information from law enforcement agencies** _REMARK: the rate of requests for user information from law enforcement agencies is low.

NOTE: The disclosure rate indicates cases where at least some data has been disclosed. Cases of non-disclosure include situations where TikTok requested additional information or clarification regarding the data disclosure request and the requesting law enforcement agencies did not provide the necessary information in accordance with our [guidelines for law enforcement agencies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement?lang=en) and/or where TikTok rejected the request due to incomplete or invalid legal proceedings. Data retention requests are official requests made by law enforcement agencies to retain data so that they have sufficient time to initiate a valid legal proceeding for the release of the data._

### About this report

TikTok is committed to responding to law enforcement requests for user information while respecting the privacy and rights of its community members.

### About this report

TikTok is committed to complying with legitimate requests from legal authorities, while respecting the privacy and rights of its users. To obtain non-public information about users' personal data, legal authorities must provide the legal documents required for the type of information sought, such as a subpoena, court order or warrant, or submit an emergency request. Any request for information we receive is carefully examined to determine whether it is legally justified, for example if the requesting entity is authorized to gather evidence as part of a police investigation, or to investigate an emergency situation presenting imminent danger.

In exceptional emergency situations, TikTok will disclose users' personal data without legal procedure. This may occur when, in good faith, we have reason to believe that sharing information is necessary in the face of imminent risk of death or serious physical harm. For more information on our rules and procedures, please see our [Guidelines for data requests from law enforcement agencies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement?lang=fr).

### About this report

TikTok is committed to complying with requests from public authorities whenever they are legally admissible, while respecting the confidentiality and rights of its users. To obtain non-public information about a user, the requesting entity is required to produce the legal documentation corresponding to the type of information sought, such as a subpoena, court order or letter rogatory, or to send an urgent request. All requests received are carefully examined to determine whether they are legally justified; for example, whether the requesting entity is authorized to gather evidence as part of a police investigation, or to investigate an emergency situation presenting imminent danger.

We therefore ask public authorities to submit their request in writing, accompanied by the appropriate legal documents. We will not consider requests that are not made through the appropriate channels. To find out more about our policies and practices, please see our [Guidelines for data requests from law enforcement agencies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement).

### About this report

The sections below outline the volume of legal requests received from governments and local authorities worldwide in the second half of 2019 and the nature of our response. We respect the rights and privacy of our users. For this reason, we ask public authorities to submit their request in writing, accompanied by the appropriate legal documents. We will not consider requests that are not made through the appropriate channels.

Any request for information we receive is carefully examined to determine whether it is legally justified; for example, whether the requesting entity is authorized to gather evidence as part of a police investigation or to investigate an emergency situation presenting imminent danger. To find out more about our policies and practices, please see our [Guidelines for data requests from law enforcement agencies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement).
