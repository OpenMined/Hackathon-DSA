Withdrawal requests from public authorities

January 1, 2023 - June 30, 2023

_Publication date: November 10, 2023_

### About this report

TikTok relies on the creativity of our community, and we are committed to encouraging and protecting the personal expression and entertainment value of the platform. However, in some cases, we will remove or restrict content flagged by public bodies. We will deal with requests made to us through the appropriate channels and where required by law. When we receive such requests from public authorities, we review them and take action regarding the reported content in accordance with our [Community Rules](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) and applicable laws. If we consider that a request does not infringe the provisions set out in our Community Rules but does infringe applicable legislation, we may impose restrictions on the distribution of the reported content in the country where it is considered to be contrary to the law. If we consider that a request is not legally justified or does not infringe our Community Rules, our General Terms and Conditions or current legislation, we reserve the right to reject the request. The sections below indicate the volume of withdrawal or restriction requests received from governments and the nature of the response given by TikTok.

Withdrawal requests from public authorities

July 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022  
_Publication May 15, 2023_

### **About this report**

TikTok relies on the creativity of our community, and we are committed to encouraging and protecting the personal expression and entertainment value of the platform. However, in some cases, we will remove or restrict content flagged by public bodies. We will deal with requests made to us through the appropriate channels and where required by law. When we receive such requests from public authorities, we review them and take action regarding the reported content in accordance with our [Community Rules](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) and applicable laws. If we consider that a request does not infringe the provisions set out in our Community Rules but does infringe applicable legislation, we may impose restrictions on the distribution of the reported content in the country where it is considered to be contrary to the law. If we consider that a request is not legally justified or does not infringe our Community Rules, our General Terms and Conditions or current legislation, we reserve the right to reject the request.

The sections below indicate the volume of withdrawal or restriction requests received from governments and the nature of the response given by TikTok.

### **Analysis**

In the second half of 2022, we received fewer requests to remove or restrict content or accounts than in our last report. We believe this is due in part to the suspension of live streaming and new content publications on our video service in Russia, which resulted in an overall drop in the total number of requests received.

The sections below indicate the volume of withdrawal or restriction requests received from governments and the nature of the response given by TikTok.

### **Analysis**

A greater number of markets have made withdrawal requests compared with our last reporting period. The easing of COVID-19 restrictions in some markets led to a decrease in request volumes, while other conflicted markets saw an increase in withdrawal requests.

### About this report

We take any request from government bodies extremely seriously, and closely review each such request we receive to determine whether, for example, the request adheres to the required legal process or the content violates a local law. TikTok is committed to assisting law enforcement in appropriate circumstances while respecting the privacy and rights of our users.

The sections below provide insight into the requests we received from government bodies in the markets where the TikTok app operates during the first half of 2019. We did not receive any requests from countries other than those listed in the chart below. In addition, we have also included a description of our copyright take-down process.
