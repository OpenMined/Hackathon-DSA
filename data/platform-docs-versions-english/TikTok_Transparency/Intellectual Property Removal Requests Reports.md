### **About this report**

The creativity of our community is at the heart of TikTok; it's what makes it a unique entertainment venue. Our platform encourages users to unleash their creativity, and we do our best to protect it. Our Community Rules and Terms and Conditions prohibit any content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party.

The sections below show requests for removal of content for copyright and trademark infringement, and the rate of content removed.

### **Analysis**

Compared to the last reporting period, we have seen an increase in the number of takedown requests based on copyright and trademark infringement. We believe this is partly due to high-profile sporting events (e.g. the FIFA World Cup), our efforts to improve engagement with rights holders around sharing best practice for submitting valid requests, and our work to improve the efficiency of our email verification processes. For example, we now ask users to verify their e-mail address before they can submit a report, which has reduced the volume of spam and invalid reports we receive. In addition, we have seen a decrease in the number of honored requests for deletions related to copyright and trademark laws compared to the previous period. We believe this can be attributed in part to our efforts to deploy new tools that improve our ability to detect false owners and multiple requests to remove the same content.
