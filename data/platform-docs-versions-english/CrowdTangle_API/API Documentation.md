### [](#getting-started)Getting Started

Welcome to the CrowdTangle API! You can use the CrowdTangle API to access posts, the leaderboard and the link-checker. Please contact your CrowdTangle representative for access. If you have access to the API, you can locate your API token via your dashboard under Settings > API Access.

#### [](#authentication)Authentication

The CrowdTangle API expects the API token to be included either as a custom header with the name `x-api-token` or as a `token` query parameter.

    // as a custom header
    curl "https://api.crowdtangle.com/posts"
      -H "x-api-token: your-api-token"
    
    // as a query parameter 
    curl "https://api.crowdtangle.com/posts?token=your-api-token"
    

#### [](#making-a-request)Making a Request

All requests to the CrowdTangle API are made via GET to `https://api.crowdtangle.com/`. You must use https. Please visit the [API Cheat Sheet](https://help.crowdtangle.com/en/articles/3443476-api-cheat-sheet) to understand how pagination works with our API.

[](#get-posts)GET /posts
------------------------

Retrieve a set of posts for the given parameters.

#### [](#endpoint)Endpoint

`GET https://api.crowdtangle.com/posts`

#### [](#parameters)Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accounts | `null` (any account in the List or Dashboard) | a string corresponding to account handles (ie iamcardib) or platform IDs (ie 1436859892) | The account handles or platform ids to search. These can be separated by commas to include multiple accounts. |
| brandedContent | `no_filter` e.g. all | `as_publisher`, `as_marketer`, `exclude`, `no_filter` | Limits to or excludes posts that have been marked as Branded Content, either as Publisher or Marketer. |
| count | `10` | `1-100` | The number of posts to return. |
| endDate | now | \-  | The latest date at which a post could be posted. Time zone is UTC. Format is ‚Äúyyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss‚Äù or ‚Äúyyyy-mm-dd‚Äù (defaults to time 00:00:00). |
| includeHistory | `null` (does not include) | `true` | Includes timestep data for growth of each post returned. Note that we will not have time-series data for posts that were created after the account was added to CrowdTangle. |
| language | `null` (all languages) | [2-character Locale code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) | Exceptions: Some languages require more than two characters: Chinese (Simplified) is zh-CN and Chinese (Traditional) is zh-TW. |
| listIds | `null` (i.e posts from all Lists, not including saved searches or saved posts lists, in the Dashboard) | \-  | The IDs of lists or saved searches to retrieve. These can be separated by commas to include multiple lists. |
| minInteractions | `0` | `> 0` | If set, will exclude posts with total interactions below this threshold. |
| offset | `0` | `> 0` | The number of posts to offset (generally used for pagination). Pagination links will also be provided in the response. |
| pageAdminTopCountry | `null` | [2-character country code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes#Current_ISO_3166_country_codes) | Limits to posts for which the account has the pageAdminTopCountry matching the parameter setting. |
| searchTerm | `null` | Any string | Returns only posts that match this search term. Terms AND automatically. Separate with commas for OR, use quotes for phrases. E.g. CrowdTangle API -> AND. CrowdTangle, API -> OR. "CrowdTangle API" -> AND in that exact order. You can also use traditional Boolean search with this parameter. |
| sortBy | `overperforming` | `date`, `interaction_rate`, `overperforming`, `total_interactions`, `underperforming` | The method by which to filter and order posts. |
| startDate | `null` | \-  | The earliest date at which a post could be posted. Time zone is UTC. Format is ‚Äúyyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss‚Äù or ‚Äúyyyy-mm-dd‚Äù (defaults to time 00:00:00). This must be before endDate. Timeframe and startDate are mutually exclusive; if both are passed, startDate will be preferred. |
| timeframe | `6 HOUR` | Any valid SQL interval (No, we don't pass it through to our database. Don't be silly) | The interval of time to consider from the endDate. Timeframe and startDate are mutually exclusive; if both are passed, startDate will be preferred. Depending on the number of posts, longer timeframes may not return within the timeout window. If you get a 504, try shortening your timeframe. |
| types | `null` (all) | `album`, `igtv`, `link`, `live_video`, `live_video_complete`, `live_video_scheduled`, `native_video`, `photo`, `status`, `video`, `vine`, `youtube` | The types of post to include. These can be separated by commas to include multiple types. If you want all live videos (whether currently or formerly live), be sure to include both live\_video and live\_video\_complete. The "video" type does not mean all videos, it refers to videos that aren't native\_video or youtube (e.g. a video on Vimeo). |
| verified | `no_filter` (all) | `only`, `exclude`, `no_filter` | Limits to posts where the account has the verified setting matching the input. |
| weightAngry, weightComment, weightHaha, weightLike, weightLove, weightRepost, weightSad, weightShare, weightUpvote, weightView, weightWow | 0   | 0-10 | How much weight to give to each type of interaction. If you send in no weights, all weights will use the current dashboard defaults. If you send in at least one weight, all other weights will default to 0. Weights are multiplied by interaction counts: e.g. weightsComment at 1 and all others at 0 will find the most commented-on posts. weightLike at 1 and weightShare at 2 will give shares twice the impact as likes when computing scores. |

#### [](#response)Response

The Response contains both a status code and a result. The status will always be 200 if there is no error. The result contains an array of [post objects](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Post) and a [pagination object](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Pagination) with URLs for both the next and previous page, if they exist. Below is an example response.

[](#get-postid)GET /post/:id
----------------------------

Retrieves a specific post. There are two versions of this endpoint, depending upon what you need. Both return the same data. Please note that you must use a dashboard token that corresponds to the post platform - i.e. an Instagram token for Instagram posts, and a Facebook token for Facebook posts.

Please also note that the ID format for Facebook and Instagram are different. For Instagram, it's `[post_id]_[page_id]`, while for Facebook, it's `[page_id]_[post_id]`. While Page and Post IDs can be found in Facebook post URLs, Instagram does not expose the IDs in its URLs. You can pull the necessary Instagram IDs from our API.

Search
======

[](#get-postssearch)GET /posts/search
-------------------------------------

_Note: Access to the Search is restricted to a limited set customers and usage requires prior approval by CrowdTangle. [Apply here to activate Search.](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/908993259530156)_

Retrieve a set of posts for the given parameters and search terms. This endpoint, unlike the main `/posts` endpoint, searches the entire, cross-platform CrowdTangle system of posts. It can be limited by lists and accounts, but by default will search beyond the dashboard the token is associated with.

**If you submit a query with a blank searchTerm (i.e., searchTerm=" "), the result set will be limited to the Dashboard associated with the supplied API token. System-wide blank searches are not supported by default. Please reach out to [support@crowdtangle.com](mailto:support@crowdtangle.com) for more information.**

#### [](#endpoint)Endpoint

`GET https://api.crowdtangle.com/posts/search`

#### [](#calculating-the-number-of-responses)Calculating the number of responses

To calculate the number of responses you'll get for each query, request activation of the hitCount setting [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/908993259530156). Once it's activated, make the query with your full date ranges and `count = 0`. This will return the total number of matches for the search within your date range as a hitCount property.

#### [](#parameters)Parameters

Note: **Please use startDate!** Our system works much more quickly (and with much less strain) when it only has to search a subset of dates for your data. If you're looking only for posts in 2019, put in a startDate of 2019-01-01 and our system will know it can ignore years' worth of data. If the event you're interested in happened yesterday, put that in and it will return very quickly! We're not making startDate mandatory, but please strongly consider using it!

| Parameter | Default | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Requires "platforms=facebook" to be set also. If "platforms=facebook" is not set, all post types including IG and Reddit will be returned. Only applies to Facebook. |
| and | `null` | \-  | Post search is split into OR, AND and NOT chunks. This is the AND section. Each is a phrase match, meaning that `searchTerm` is "CrowdTangle, API" and `and` is "so fast, great documentation," it will search for (("CrowdTangle" AND "so fast" AND "great documentation") OR ("API" AND "so fast" AND "great documentation")). |
| brandedContent | `no_filter` e.g. all | `as_publisher`, `as_marketer`, `exclude`, `no_filter` | Limits to or excludes posts that have been marked as Branded Content, either as Publisher or Marketer. |
| count | `10` | `1-100` | The number of posts to return. |
| endDate | now | \-  | The latest date at which a post could be posted. Time zone is UTC. Format is ‚Äúyyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss‚Äù or ‚Äúyyyy-mm-dd‚Äù (defaults to time 00:00:00). |

| inAccountIds | null | \-  | A comma-separated list of the IDs of accounts to search within. |
| includeSummary | false | true, false | Adds a "summary" section with total interaction statistics for each platform that matches your search. It will look beyond the count requested to summarize across the time searched. When includeSummary is specified, either startDate or timeframe is required. |
| inListIds | null | \-  | A comma-separated list of the IDs of lists to search within. |
| language | null (all languages) | [2-character Locale code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) | Exceptions: Some languages require more than two characters: Chinese (Simplified) is zh-CN and Chinese (Traditional) is zh-TW. |
| minInteractions | `0` | `> 0` | If set, will exclude posts with total interactions below this threshold. |
| minSubscriberCount | `0` | `> 0` | The minimum number of subscribers an account must have to be included in the search results. |
| not | `null` | \-  | A corollary to `and`, `not` will exclude all posts matching this word/phrase. |

| offset | `0` | `> 0` | The number of posts to offset (generally used for pagination). Pagination links will also be provided in the response. |
| pageAdminTopCountry | `null` | [2-character country code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes#Current_ISO_3166_country_codes) | Limits to posts for which the account has the pageAdminTopCountry matching the parameter setting. |
| pageCategories | `null` | \-  | Include one or multiple Page Categories in search results, e.g. ARTIST, TV\_NETWORK, MEDIA\_NEWS\_COMPANY. [View the full list of page categories here.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/) |

| searchTerm | `null` | Any string | Note: Use the [API request form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/908993259530156) to request activation of Boolean search for this parameter. By default, post search is split into OR, AND and NOT chunks. This is the OR section. Each is a phrase match, meaning that "CrowdTangle API, organized so cleanly" will search for "CrowdTangle API" or "organized so cleanly." If you want to find those phrases together, put one in here and put one in the AND section. This parameter does not support wildcard or partial-term searches, and is not case-sensitive. If you submit a query with a blank searchTerm (i.e., searchTerm=" "), the result set will be limited to the Dashboard associated with the supplied API token. System-wide blank searches are not supported by default. Please reach out to [support@crowdtangle.com](mailto:support@crowdtangle.com) for more information. |

This must be before endDate. Timeframe and startDate are mutually exclusive; if both are passed, startDate will be preferred. |
| timeframe | `6 HOUR` | Any valid SQL interval (No, we don't pass it through to our database. Don't be silly) | The interval of time to consider from the endDate. Timeframe and startDate are mutually exclusive; if both are passed, startDate will be preferred. |
| types | `null` (all) | `album`, `igtv`, `link`, `live_video`, `live_video_complete`, `live_video_scheduled`, `native_video`, `photo`, `status`, `video`, `youtube` | The types of post to include. These can be separated by commas to include multiple types. If you want all live videos (whether currently or formerly live), be sure to include both live\_video and live\_video\_complete. |
| verified | `no_filter` (all) | `only`, `exclude`, `no_filter` | Limits to posts where the account has the verified setting matching the input. This is in addition to the current verifiedOnly parameter. If both are included, Verified will supersede verifiedOnly. |
| verifiedOnly | `false` | \-  | Limit results to verified accounts only. Note, this only applies to platforms that supply information about verified accounts. |

#### [](#response)Response

Important Notes:

* subscriberData: Counts may not be available for selected date ranges based on when we started tracking an account within CrowdTangle. If initialCount or finalCount is 0, we likely were not tracking the account at that time. This can be confirmed by referencing the notes section which could look like this: "No subscriberCount available for beginning of time range." If the note section is present at all, any calculations made with subscriberCount data will need to take into account potentially missing data.

Links
=====

[](#get-links)GET /links
------------------------

Retrieve a set of posts matching a certain link. This will return up to 1000 posts. This endpoint only pulls data from CrowdTangle. To access interaction metrics across the entirety of Facebook, [use this Graph API endpoint.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v10.0/url)

#### [](#endpoint)Endpoint

`GET https://api.crowdtangle.com/links`

#### [](#parameters)Parameters

Note: **Please use startDate!** Our system works much more quickly (and with much less strain) when it only has to search a subset of dates for your data. If you're looking only for posts in 2019, put in a startDate of 2019-01-01 and our system will know it can ignore years' worth of data. If the URL you're interested in was published yesterday, put that in and it will return very quickly! We're not making startDate mandatory, but please strongly consider using it!

| Parameter | Default | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

This can be confirmed by referencing the notes section which could look like this: "No subscriberCount available for beginning of time range." If the note section is present at all, any calculations made with subscriberCount data will need to take into account potentially missing data. |

Pagination
==========

### [](#pagination)Pagination

An Pagination object offers API endpoints to call for the next or previous pages. The CrowdTangle API simply uses counts and offsets to paginate, so constructing your own pagination URLs is simple as well.
