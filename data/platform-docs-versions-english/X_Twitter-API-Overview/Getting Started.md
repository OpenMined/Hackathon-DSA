About the Twitter API

About the Twitter API
---------------------

The Twitter API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze Twitter data, as well as build for the conversation on Twitter.

Over the years, the Twitter API has grown by adding additional levels of access for developers and academic researchers to be able to scale their access to enhance and research the public conversation. 

Recently, we released the Twitter API v2. The Twitter API v2 includes a modern foundation, new and advanced features, and quick onboarding to [Basic access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/basic).   

The following three tabs explain the different versions and access levels of the Twitter API, what’s new with v2, and which Twitter resources you can retrieve, create, destroy, and adjust using the API.

Twitter API platform resources
------------------------------

In the API design space, a resource is an entity with associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it. For example, a Tweet is a resource that you can create, delete, or retrieve using a variety of different tools, such as historically searching for them, or retrieving them in real-time. 

The Twitter API provides access to create, delete, receive, or adjust a variety of different resources on the platform including the following:

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Tweets** | Tap into millions of Tweets to understand the public conversation, or create your own to engage with the conversation.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Twitter API v2<br>* Enterprise<br>* Premium v1.1<br>* Standard v1.1 |

Please fill out the brief survey at the bottom of each page to help us improve.

Getting access to the Twitter API

How to get access to the Twitter API
------------------------------------

### Step one: Sign up for a developer account

Signing up for a developer account is quick and easy! Just click on the button below, answer a few questions, and you can start exploring and building on the Twitter API v2 using [Basic access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/basic).

Next you will create a Project and an associated developer App during the onboarding process, which will provide you a set of credentials that you will use to authenticate all requests to the API. 

[Sign up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/basic)

###   
Step two: Save your App's key and tokens and keep them secure

Once you have access and have created a Project and App, you will be able to find or generate the following credentials within your developer App:

* **[API Key and Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret):** Essentially the username and password for your App. You will use these to authenticate requests that require [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), or to generate other tokens such as user Access Tokens or App Access Token.
    
* **[Access Token and Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens):** In general, Access Tokens represent the user that you are making the request on behalf of. The ones that you can generate via the developer portal represent the user that owns the App. You will use these to authenticate requests that require [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a). If you would like to make requests on behalf of another user, you will need to use the 3-legged OAuth flow for them to authorize you. 
    
* **[Client ID and Client Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/content/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token):** These credentials are used to obtain a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0 authentication. Similar to OAuth 1.0a, the user Access Tokens are used to authenticate requests that provide private user account information or perform actions on behalf of another account but, with fine-grained scope for greater control over what access the client application has on the user. 
    
* **[App only Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens):** You will use this token when making requests to endpoints that responds with information publicly available on Twitter.
    

Since these keys and tokens do not expire unless regenerated, we suggest that you save them in a secure location, such as a password manager, once you've received your credentials.

**Please note: Your keys and tokens will only display once in the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal), so it is important that you store these credentials in your password management system as soon as you generate them.**

If you misplace or forget the keys and tokens, you will need to regenerate them, which creates new credentials and invalidates the old ones. This means that you will have to update any integrations that you may have set up with your prior credentials.

Learn more about our [authentication best practices](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/authentication-best-practices). 

###   
  
Step three: Make your first request

What’s next? Let’s make your first request to the API!

We have guides, tutorials, tools, and code to help you get started. The following page will be a great place to start, but note that we’ve also put together an important resources page to help you navigate the broader documentation.

[Make your first request](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/make-your-first-request)

Next step
---------

Find an endpoint to start working with via our [API reference index](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index). 

We also have a set of Twitter API [tools and libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) that you can use to speed up your integration.

Make your first request

Make your first request to the Twitter API
------------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through some steps that you could follow to make your first request. This is a great resource to help you once you’ve signed up for a Twitter account. 

If you are interested in using code samples, more technical guides, or a graphical tool like Postman, please consider using the following guides to make your first request:

* [Step-by-step guide to making your first request to the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-request-to-the-twitter-api-v2)
* [A quick start guide to making your first request to the post Tweet endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/quick-start)
* [Getting started with Postman](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started) - best for beginners
* [Twitter API v2 code samples](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)
* [Tweet lookup API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/api-reference)  
      
    

This guide assumes that you have collected your [API key and secret](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret), [user Access Token and Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens), [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens), and have stored them in a secure location. You can learn how to do this by following the steps in the [getting access to the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) guide.   
 

### Step 1. Identify which endpoint you would like to use

The Twitter API allows you to perform a variety of different actions using code that you might be able to perform on the Twitter website or mobile application. 

We have a complete list of the endpoints that are available via the API listed within our [API Reference Index](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index), but we recommend sticking to one of the following for simplicity’s sake:

* [Manage Tweets > Post a Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets)
* [Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search)
* [User lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup)  
    

### Step 2. Choose a tool to make your request

While some requests can be straightforward, others can be tricky to build. That’s why the amazing community of developers have developed tools to abstract away some of the complexity. 

The following are some recommended tools and details on how to use them:

#### Postman

Postman is a visual tool that you can use to make requests to REST endpoints. We’ve created some great materials around Postman to help you get started with and explore the different endpoints available via the Twitter API. 

We recommend you read through our ["Getting started with Postman" tutorial](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started) to learn how to add your keys and tokens and make your first request. 

We’ve also produced a quick start guide for each of our Twitter API v2 endpoints, most of which use Postman. You can find these guides in each respective endpoint section, but here is a link to a few:

* Quick start: Post a Tweet
* Quick start: Search for Tweets
* Quick start: Lookup a user  
     

Please note that you can’t make requests to streaming endpoints using Postman. Please visit the [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/quick-start) or [1% ampled stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/volume-streams/quick-start/sampled-stream) quick start guide to learn how to work with those endpoints.

If you prefer a more simple graphical tool, you should also consider using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).   
 

#### Sample code

If you are interested in using some simple code to make your request, we’ve put together sample code in multiple different languages for each of our Twitter API v2 endpoints. 

You can find the code samples via our Github repo, [Twitter-API-v2-sample-code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code), which also contains a README file that you can use to learn how to set up your credentials to properly work with the requests. 

For example, here is a cURL example for the user lookup endpoint. All you have to do to use this request is replace the $ACCESS\_TOKEN and $USERNAME with your [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) and Twitter handle. Then, copy and paste this code into your command line tool and press ‘Return’ or ‘Enter’.

      `curl "https://api.twitter.com/2/users/by/username/$USERNAME" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"`
    

#### Libraries

The amazing TwitterDev community has also built libraries in a variety of different coding languages that can be used to make requests to the Twitter API.

We’ve built out a ["Tools and libraries" page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) that lists all of the community libraries that we are aware of. Each library should have a ReadMe file that can be used to learn how to set up the repo on your machine and make your first request.

**Please note:** If you run into any problems, please read through our developer docs for the endpoint that you are making a request to, our [support section](https://developer.twitter.com/en/support), or reach out to the community on our forums for help. We’ll get you to a successful request!

### Step 3. Review the response

Once you’ve made a successful request, you will receive a payload with metadata related to the request. 

If you used an endpoint that utilizes a GET HTTP method, you will receive metadata related to the resource (Tweet, user, List, Space, etc) that you made the request to in JSON format. Review the different fields that returned and see if you can map the information that you requested to the content on Twitter.

If you used an endpoint that utilizes a POST, PUT, or DELETE HTTP method, you performed an action on Twitter. Go to Twitter.com or the mobile app and see if you can track down that action. 

### Step 4. Adjust your request using parameters

Each endpoint has a different set of parameters that you can use to alter your request. For example, you can request additional metadata fields when using GET endpoints with the fields and expansions parameters. You can also experiment with a variety of different filtering tools with endpoints such as [search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search), [Tweet counts](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts), and [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream) to help narrow down the data you receive to just those Tweets that you are interested in. 

You can find a full list of the request parameters and fields in the API Reference for the endpoint that you are working with, and a host of other helpful integration information in our integration guides and fundamentals pages. 

You can learn more about all of the educational materials we’ve made available to you via our [Important resources](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/important-resources) guide.

Important resources

Learn about what's possible
---------------------------

Our use cases, solutions, and product pages that are accessible from the top navigation are a great way to get a high-level overview of what’s possible on the platform. 

We have also built out several [tutorials](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tutorials) that help you identify how to use one or many different platform tools to satisfy a variety of different use cases. 

At the lowest-level of our documentation lives our endpoint and tool docs, which all include introductory content that provides a brief overview of that tool’s functionality and typical use case. For example, here is our Twitter API v2 endpoint section for [Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search).  
 

### Integrate an endpoint into your system

To make your integration with our endpoints seamless, we have built out a set of tools, libraries, and integration guides. The easiest way to integrate is to use our [tools and libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), which automatically handle complex functionality such as [OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), pagination, and [rate limit handling](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/rate-limits). 

If you would rather build a solution from the ground up, our endpoint integration guides describe the functionality and best practices around integrating our endpoints into your system. These guides can be found in the different endpoint and tool documentation, listed as ‘integrate’ or simply ‘guides’. For example, here is an integration guide on [how to build a rule for the Filter stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule).  
 

### Troubleshoot an issue

If you are running into an error or have a question, please check out our [support hub](https://developer.twitter.com/en/support/twitter-api). There, you will find troubleshooting tips, answers to frequently asked questions and other useful resources.   
 

### Keep up-to-date with the latest releases

We frequently release updates to the platform to unlock new Twitter functionality via the API. In addition to this, we aim to release at least one new major version bump per year, which will include some breaking changes.
