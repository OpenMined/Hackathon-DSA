Direct Messages are one of the most popular features of Twitter, with a wide variety of use cases. These use cases range from group chats among friends to powering customer support for brands around the world. New v2 versions of Direct Messages endpoints will be introduced in stages, and this first stage includes fundamental endpoints for creating Direct Messages and listing Direct Message conversation events.\u00a0For the first time, the Twitter API v2 supports\u00a0_group_\u00a0conversations.  \nThis initial release of Direct Messages lookup includes three GET methods:  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/dm\\_events** \\- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a one-to-one conversation.\u00a0The\u00a0:participant\\_id path parameter is the User ID of the account having the conversation with the authenticated user making this request.\n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a specific conversation ID, as indicated by the :dm\\_conversation\\_id\u00a0path parameter.\n* **GET /2/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a user, including both one-to-one and group conversations. Events from up to 30 days ago are available.  \nNote that Direct Message event IDs are common across the v1.1 and v2 (as well as the Twitter App), so the v1.1 method to list a single event can be used along with these new v2 endpoints. Also note that the Enterprise and Premium Account Activity APIs support v2 one-to-one messages, but do not yet support group conversations.  \nWith this release, three event types are supported, and these endpoints support query parameters to filter on them:  \n* **MessageCreate** - A message has been created.\n* **ParticipantsJoin** - A new participant has joined a conversation.\n* **ParticipantsLeave** - A participant has left a conversation.  \nThere is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for the GET methods. This rate limit is shared across these GET endpoints.  \nSince you are making requests on behalf of a user with Direct Message v2 endpoints, you must authenticate with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), using Access Tokens associated with users that have authorized your Twitter App. To generate these Access Tokens with OAuth 1.0a, you can use the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens). To generate user Access Tokens with OAuth 2.0, you can use the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/direct-messages/lookup/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=/2/tweets&method=get)\n",

We'll then add a second message to the created conversation.  \n#### Step one: Start with a tool or library  \nTo begin working with the manage Direct Message endpoints we are going to use the Postman tool to simplify the process. A TwitterDev-authored collection of example Twitter API v2 requests will be used to explore six endpoints used to create new Direct Messages and to list Direct Message conversation events.  \nWhile most of the collection is pre-filled, there are a few details that you'll need to provide that are based on the Twitter App created to host these API requests. First, let's get the collection loaded/updated.  \nTo load Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:  \n[Add Twitter API v2 to Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \nOnce you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the \u201cManage Direct Messages\u201d folder. This folder's Authorization tab has been pre-filled where possible. You will need to update a few settings to share your Twitter App's authentication details.  \nThis folder also contains three endpoints for creating new Direct Messages. Note that there is also a \"Direct Message lookup\" folder with three available endpoints for retrieving Direct Message conversation events, including sending and receiving messages, and when conversation participants join and leave.  \nSince creating group conversations is a new feature of the Twitter API v2, this example will focus on that. We will be working with the \"New group DM and conversation\" example. We will use this request to create a Direct Message group conversation.  \nThe next step is to authenticate with the endpoint.  \n####\nStep two: Authenticate your request  \nTo properly make a request to the Twitter API, you need to verify that you have permission to do so. To make a successful request to this endpoint, we will be using [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code). You can generate an access token within Postman.  \nWith Postman you can set the authentication method at the folder level or at the request level. Here we will be configuring the authentication details at the folder level. Navigate to the \"Mange Direct Messages\" folder, select the \"Authorization\" tab and confirm that the Type to set to \u201cOAuth 2.0\u201d, and \"Add auth data to\" is set to \"Request Headers.\" In the \"Current Token\" section, make sure the \"header Prefix\" is set to Bearer.  \nTo configure and generate a new token:  \n1. Create a Token Name, such as \"DM lookup.\"  \n2. Confirm that **Grant Type** is set to Authorization Code (with PKCE).  \n3. Set your **Callback URL**. You will want to update your Callback URL to exactly match the Callback URL associated with your application in the [v2 Dev Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). With the Twitter App used with this example, the Callback URL is set to - [https://www.example.com.](https://www.example.com/) (Note that since this must match exactly, [https://example.com](https://example.com/) would not work.)  \n4. Confirm that **Auth URL** is set to [https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize](https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize)  \n5. Confirm that **Access Token URL** is set to [https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token.](https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token)**Client ID** \\- Copy and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the Developer Portal\n**Client Secret** - You will need this only if you are using an App type that is a confidential client. If so, copy and paste the OAuth 2.0 Client Secret from the Developer Portal.  \n6. Confirm that **Scope** is set to dm.read dm.write tweet.read users.read.  \n7. Confirm that **State** is set to \u201cstate.\u201d  \n8. Confirm that **Client Authentication** is set to Send as Basic Auth header.  \n9. Click where it says \u201cGet New Access Token\u201d, click \"Authorize app\" as part of the \"Sign-in with Twitter\" process.  \n10. Click the \"Proceed\" button and then the \"Use Token\" to generate a token.  \n11. Click on the \"Save\" button to save these configuration details.  \nYou may get a message that you are not logged into Twitter. If you get this error, you will need to log in to the Twitter account\u00a0that you are trying to post on behalf of inside of Postman.  \nNow that these OAuth 2.0 details have been set at the folder level, navigate to each of the examples and their \"Authorization\" tab and confirm that they have their Type set to \"Inherit auth from parent.\"  \nNote that this token will expire soon, and you'll need to regenerate it by clicking on the \"Get New Access Token\" button. Clicking that will trigger the \"Sign-in with Twitter\" process and generate a fresh token to make requests with.  \n#### Step three: Retrieve Direct Messages conversation events  \nWhen retrieving Direct Message conversation events with this endpoint, you need to specify a conversation ID. The conversation ID is part of the endpoint path: https://api.twitter.com/2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/dm\\_events  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \u201cParams\u201d tab and enter the ID of the conversation you want to retrieve events for in the \"Path Variables\" section.  \nThe setting would be:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `dm_conversation_id` | `1228393702244134912` |  \nWith this conversation specified, the resulting path becomes https://api.twitter.com/2/dm\\_conversations/1582103724607971328/dm\\_events  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button you will receive the default Direct Message object fields in your response: id, \u00a0text, and event\\_type. There will also be a \"meta\" object with the number of results, along with pagination tokens used for retrieving more events if available.  \n`{    \"data\": [        {            \"event_type\": \"MessageCreate\",            \"id\": \"1580705921830768647\",            \"text\": \"hello to you two, this is a new group conversation.\"        }    ],    \"meta\": {        \"result_count\": 1,        \"next_token\": \"18LAA5FFPEKJA52G0G00ZZZZ\",        \"previous_token\": \"1BLC45FFPEKJA52G0S00ZZZZ\"    } }`  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request additional sets of fields of the dm\\_event object:  \n1. The default Direct Message object fields, id, text, and event\\_type.  \n2. Additional Direct Message object fields: dm\\_conversation\\_id, created\\_at, sender\\_id, attachments, participant\\_ids, referenced\\_tweets  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Key | Value |\n| dm\\_event.fields | dm\\_conversation\\_id,created\\_at,sender\\_id,attachments,participant\\_ids,referenced\\_tweets |  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     |     |     |\n|     |     |     |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/dm\\_events?dm\\_event.fields=id,text,event\\_type,dm\\_conversation\\_id,created\\_at,sender\\_id,attachments,participant\\_ids,referenced\\_tweets  \n#### Step four: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button again, and you will receive a response similar to the below response. Note that this response includes all the available dm\\_event fields.  \n`{    \"data\": [        {            \"text\": \"hello to you two, this is a new group conversation.\",            \"id\": \"1580705921830768647\",            \"dm_conversation_id\": \"1580705921830768643\",            \"event_type\": \"MessageCreate\",            \"sender_id\": \"17200003\",            \"created_at\": \"2022-10-13T23:43:54.000Z\"        }    ],    \"meta\": {        \"result_count\": 1,        \"next_token\": \"18LAA5FFPEKJA52G0G00ZZZZ\",        \"previous_token\": \"1BLC45FFPEKJA52G0S00ZZZZ\"    } }`\n",

These conversations can be one-to-one conversations or group conversations. This launch provides the foundational endpoints needed to create Direct Messages and retrieve events associated with Direct Message conversations. All conversations have a unique dm\\_conversation\\_id, and the events that make up that conversation all have a unique dm\\_event\\_id.  \nThe Direct Message lookup endpoints provide methods for retrieving events associated with conversations. These GET endpoints are used to retrieve the messages that make up a conversation, and for group conversations, can be used to understand who has joined and left group conversations.  \nThis initial release of Direct Messages lookup includes three GET methods:  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a one-to-one conversation. The :participant\\_id path parameter is the numeric User ID of the account having the conversation with the authenticated user making this request.  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a specific conversation ID, as indicated by the :dm\\_conversation\\_id path parameter. Both one-to-one and group conversations IDs are supported.  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with the authenticating user, including both one-to-one and group conversations. Events from up to 30 days ago are available.  \nThese GET endpoints all support retrieving dm\\_events by event type with an event\\_types request query parameters. Currently, there are three conversation event types supported:  \n* **MessageCreate** - Created when a new Direct Message is created. This event object can include the time and text of the message, along with the account ID of who sent the message, and the conversation and event IDs.  \n* **ParticipantsJoin** - Created when a new participant joins a group conversation. This dm\\_event object includes the ID of the participant joining, along with the created\\_at time and the sender\\_id of the 'invite' event.  \n* **ParticipantsLeave** - Created when a participant leaves a conversation.This event object includes the ID of the participant leaving, along with the time of the event.  \nFor more information see the [Direct Messages lookup API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/direct-messages/lookup/api-reference).\n",

All Direct Messages are private and require user authorization to access them.  \nThese Direct Message endpoints require the use of [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/integrate#authentication) or [1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are requesting on behalf of. If you want to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth user-context can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend using a [library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code) allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user. The Direct Messages lookup endpoints require these scopes: \u00a0dm.read, tweet.read, user.read  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your\u2019s App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.\n",

This guide is intended to help understand the differences and provide information for migrating to v2.  \nA major difference between the two versions is that v1.1 supports only one-to-one conversations, while v2 introduces support for group conversations. One artifact of this is that v1.1 supports only \"message created\" events, while v2 also supports events associated with participants joining and leaving conversations. In fact, a fundamental v2 update is establishing dm\\_conversations as a core API object.  \nWith v1.1. there are two endpoints for retrieving Direct Messages (again, new messages are the only event type supported with v1.1):  \n* [GET direct\\_messages/events/show](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/get-event) - Retrieves a single event by ID.  \n* [GET direct\\_messages/events/list](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/list-events) - Retrieves up to 30 days of one-to-one Direct Messages sent and received by the authenticated user. Note that this method is not able to retrieve messages from group conversations.  \nWith this v2 release, there are three GET methods for retrieving Direct Message conversation events:  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a one-to-one conversation. The :participant\\_id path parameter is the User ID of the account having the conversation with the authenticated user making this request.  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a specific conversation ID, as indicated by the :dm\\_conversation\\_id path parameter. This method supports both one-to-one and group conversations.  \n* **GET /2/dm\\_events** - Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a user, including both one-to-one and group conversations. Events from up to 30 days ago are available.  \nAn important detail is that conversation and event IDs are shared across v1.1 and v2 versions of the Twitter Platform. This means both versions can be used together. For example, the Direct Messages v1.1 endpoints provide methods for returning a single event and for deleting events, methods not yet available with v2. Since IDs are common across v1.1 and v2, you can make v1.1 requests based on IDs provided by v2, or by referencing conversation IDs displayed in conversation URLs on the Twitter application.  \nThe following table compares fundamental aspects of the v1.1 and v2 Direct Message event lookup endpoints. The Twitter API v2 characteristics shared here are common to all of the Direct Message lookup endpoints.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **Standard v1.1** | **Twitter API v2** |\n| Host domain | https://api.twitter.com | https://api.twitter.com |\n| Endpoint root path | [/1.1/direct\\_messages](https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages) | [/2/dm\\_conversations](https://api.twitter.com/2/users/:id/dm_conversations)<br><br>Direct Messages conversations are introduced as a fundamental API object.\u00a0  <br><br>These endpoints retrieve MessageCreate, ParticipantsJoin, and ParticipantLeave events. |\n| HTTP methods supported | GET | GET |\n| Supports Group Direct Messages |     | \u2714   |\n| Event types supported | message\\_create | MessageCreate, ParticipantsJoin, ParticipantsLeave |\n| [Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication) | OAuth 1.0a User Context | OAuth 1.0a User Context<br><br>OAuth 2 User Context (scopes: dm.read, tweet.read, user.read) |\n| Requires the use of credentials from a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication) associated with a Twitter API v2 [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) |     | \u2714   |\n| Default request [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits)\\*  <br>\\*All requests require user tokens |     | GET requests: 300 requests per 15 mins<br><br>Rate limit is applied across all three endpoints |  \nThe following tables compare the v2 GET methods with version v1.1.

Direct Messages are one of the most popular features of Twitter, with a wide variety of use cases. These use cases range from group chats among friends, to powering customer support for brands around the world.\u00a0New v2 versions of Direct Messages endpoints will be introduced in stages, and this first stage includes fundamental endpoints for creating Direct Messages and listing Direct Message conversation events.\u00a0For the first time, the Twitter API v2 supports\u00a0_group_\u00a0conversations.  \nThis initial release of Manage Direct Messages includes three POST methods for creating Direct Messages:  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/messages**\u00a0- Creates a one-to-one Direct Message.\u00a0This method either creates a new 1-1 conversation or retrieves the current conversation and adds the Direct Message to it. The :participant\\_idpath parameter is the User ID of the account receiving the message.\n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations** - Creates a new group conversation and adds a Direct Message to it. These requests require a list of conversation participants. Note that you can create multiple conversations with the same participant list. These requests will always return a new conversation ID.\n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/messages** -\u00a0Creates a Direct Message and adds it to an existing conversation. The :dm\\_conversation\\_id path parameter is the ID of the conversation that the message will be added to.  \nNote that Direct Message event IDs are common across the v1.1 and v2 (as well as the Twitter App), so the v1.1 methods to hide/delete Direct Messages can be used along with this new v2 endpoint. Also note that the Enterprise and Premium Account Activity APIs support v2 one-to-one messages, but do not yet support group conversations.  \nThere is a user rate limit of 200 requests per 15 minutes for the POST method. There is also a rate limit of 1000 requests per 24 hours per user. Additionally, there is a rate limit of 15000 requests per 24 hours. Note that these rate limits are shared across these POST endpoints.  \nSince you are making requests on behalf of a user with the manage Tweets endpoints, you must authenticate with either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), and use a user Access Tokens associated with a user that has authorized your App. To generate this user Access Token with OAuth 1.0a, you can use the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens). To generate a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0, you can use the\u00a0[Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/direct-messages/manage/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=/2/tweets&method=post)\n",

We'll then add a second message to the created conversation.  \n#### Step one: Start with a tool or library  \nTo begin working with the manage Direct Message endpoints, we are going to use the Postman tool to simplify the process. A TwitterDev-authored collection of example Twitter API v2 requests will be used to explore six endpoints used to create new Direct Messages and to list Direct Message conversation events.  \nWhile most of the collection is pre-filled, there are a few details that you'll need to provide that are based on the Twitter App created to host these API requests. First, let's get the collection loaded/updated.  \nTo load the Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:  \n[Add Twitter API v2 to Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \nOnce you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the \u201cManage Direct Messages\u201d folder. This folder's Authorization tab has been pre-filled where possible, and you can update a few settings to share your Twitter App's authentication details. This folder also contains three endpoints for creating new Direct Messages. Note that there is also a \"Direct Message lookup\" folder with three available endpoints for retrieving Direct Message conversation events, including sending and receiving messages, and when conversation participants join and leave..  \nSince creating group conversations is an exciting new feature of the Twitter API v2, this example will focus on that. We will be working with the \"New group DM and conversation\" example. We will use this request to create a Direct Message group conversation.  \nThe next step is to authenticate with the endpoint.  \n**Step two: Authenticate your request**  \nTo properly make a request to the Twitter API, you need to verify that you have permission to do so. To make a successful request to this endpoint, we will be using [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code). You can generate an access token within Postman.  \nWith Postman you can set the authentication method at the folder level or at the request level. Here we will be configuring the authentication details at the folder level.  \nNavigate to the \"Manage Direct Messages\" folder, select the \"Authorization\" tab and confirm that the Type to set to \u201cOAuth 2.0,\u201d and \"Add auth data to\" is set to \"Request Headers.\" In the \"Current Token\" section, make sure the \"header Prefix\" is set to Bearer.  \nTo configure and generate a new token:  \n1. Create a Token Name, such as \"Manage DMs.\"  \n2. Confirm that **Grant Type** is set to Authorization Code (with PKCE).  \n3. Set your **Callback URL**. You will want to update your Callback URL to exactly match the Callback URL associated with your application in the [v2 Dev Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). With the Twitter App used with this example, the Callback URL is set to - [_https://www.example.com_.](https://www.example.com/) (Note that since this must match exactly, [_https://example.com_](https://example.com/) would not work.)  \n4. Confirm that **Auth URL** is set to [https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize](https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize).  \n5. Confirm that **Access Token URL** is set to [https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token.](https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token)**Client ID** - Copy and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the Developer Portal\n**Client Secret** - You will need this only if you are using an App type that is a confidential client. If so, copy and paste the OAuth 2.0 Client Secret from the Developer Portal.  \n6. Confirm that **Scope** is set to dm.read, dm.write, tweet.read, and users.read.  \n7. Confirm that **State** is set to \u201cstate.\u201d  \n8. Confirm that **Client Authentication** is set to Send as Basic Auth header.  \n9. Click where it says **Get New Access Token**, click \"Authorize app\" as part of the \"Sign-in with Twitter\" process.  \n10. Click the \"Proceed\" button and then the \"Use Token\" to generate a token.  \n11. Click on the \"Save\" button to save these configuration details.  \nYou may get a message that you are not logged into Twitter. If you get this error, you will need to log in to the Twitter account\u00a0you are trying to post on behalf of inside of Postman.  \nNow that these OAuth 2.0 details have been set at the folder level, navigate to each of the examples and their \"Authorization\" tab and confirm that they have their Type set to \"Inherit auth from parent.\"  \nNote that this token will expire soon, and you'll need to regenerate it by clicking on the \"Get New Access Token\" button. Clicking that will trigger the \"Sign-in with Twitter\" process and generate a fresh token to make requests with.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify the Direct Message conversation participants and message contents  \nNavigate to the \u201cBody\u201d tab and make updates to the example JSON object. Set the participant\\_ids attribute to the accounts you want to send the Direct Message to.  \n`{    \"message\": {\"text\": \"Hello to just you two, this is a new group conversation.\"},    \"participant_ids\": [\"944480690\",\"906948460078698496\"],    \"conversation_type\": \"Group\"        }`  \n#### Step four:\u00a0Make your request and review the response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button, and you will receive a similar response to the example response below. A reminder that if your token has expired since you created it above, you can return to the folder's Authorization tab and click on the \"Get New Access Token\" to create a fresh token.  \n`{    \"data\": {        \"dm_conversation_id\": \"1582103724607971328\",        \"dm_event_id\": \"1582103724607971332\"    } }`  \nIf the returned response \"data\" object contains a dm\\_conversation\\_id and an dm\\_event\\_id, you have successfully created a new Direct Message conversation. To start looking up events associated with this conversation, head over to the Direct Message lookup Quick start guide.  \n#### Step five:\u00a0Add another message to that group conversation  \nNow select the \"Add DM to conversation\" example, and select the \"Params\" tab. Under \"Path Variables\" , update the dm\\_conversation\\_id to the ID of the conversation you created above.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| dm\\_conversation\\_id | 1582103724607971328 |  \nUsing this conversation ID, the request path will resolve to: https://api.twitter.com/2/dm\\_conversations/1582103724607971328/messages  \nAlso, update the \"Body\" tab with request JSON containing the message text you want to send:  \n`{    \"text\": \"Adding a new message to our group conversation...\" }`  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button, and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:  \n`{    \"data\": {        \"dm_conversation_id\": \"1582103724607971328\",        \"dm_event_id\": \"1582106224379559940\"    } }`\n",

These conversations can be one-to-one conversations or group conversations. This launch provides the foundational endpoints needed to create Direct Messages and retrieve events associated with Direct Message conversations. All conversations have a unique dm\\_conversation\\_id, and the events that make up that conversation all have a unique dm\\_event\\_id.  \nThe Manage Direct Message endpoints provide three POST methods for creating new messages and adding them to conversations:  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/messages** - Creates a one-to-one Direct Message. This method either adds the message to an existing one-to-one conversation or creates a new one. The :participant\\_id path parameter is the User ID of the account receiving the message.\nHere is an example JSON request body for sending a one-to-one Direct Message:  \n`{    \"text\": \"Hello just you. This will appear as a new conversation if we have never messaged, or will be added to our existing thread. \" }`  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations** - Creates a new group conversation and adds a Direct Message to it. These requests require a list of conversation participants. Note that you can create multiple conversations with the same participant list. These requests will always return a new conversation ID.\u00a0Below is an example JSON request body for creating a new group conversation and adding a Direct Message. Note that this requires a \"conversation\\_type\" field and that must be set to \"Group\" (case sensitive).  \n`{    \"message\": {\"text\": \"Hello to just you two, this is a new group conversation.\"},    \"participant_ids\": [\"944480690\",\"906948460078698496\"],    \"conversation_type\": \"Group\"        }`  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/messages** \\- Creates a Direct Message and adds it to an existing conversation. The :dm\\_conversation\\_id path parameter is the ID of the conversation that the message will be added to. This method can be used to add a message to both one-to-one and group conversations.\nHere is an example JSON request body for sending Direct Message to both one-to-one and group conversations:  \n`{    \"text\": \"Here is a new message.\" }`  \nThese POST methods support attaching a single piece of media. POST request bodies must include either or both the \"text\" and \"attachments\" fields. The \"text\" attribute is required if the \"attachments\" field is not included, and the \"attachments\" field is required if the \"text\" field is not included. See the next section for more information.  \nFor more information see the [Manage Direct Messages API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/direct-messages/manage/api-reference).\n",

This means both versions can be used together.  \nFor example, the Direct Messages v1.1 endpoints provide methods for returning a single event and for deleting events. These methods are not yet available with v2. Since IDs are common across v1.1 and v2, you can make v1.1 requests based on IDs provided by v2, or by referencing conversation IDs displayed in conversation URLs on the Twitter application.\n",

Attaching media requires a media ID generated by the v1.1 [Upload media](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/media/upload-media/overview) endpoint. The authenticated user posting the Direct Message must have also uploaded the media. Once uploaded, media is available for 24 hours for including with the message.  \nTo illustrate how to include media, the following is an example JSON request body:  \n`{  \"text\": \"Here's a photo...\",  \"attachments\": [{\"media_id\": \"1583157113245011970}] }`  \nThe resulting MessageCreate event will include the following metadata:  \n`{     \"attachments\": {         \"media_keys\": [             \"5_1583157113245011970\"         ]     } }`  \nTweets can also be included by including the Tweet URL in the message text. To illustrate how to include Tweets in messages, the following is an example JSON request body:  \n`{  \"text\": \"Here's the Tweet I has talking about: https://twitter.com/SnowBotDev/status/1580559079470145536\" }`  \nThe resulting MessageCreate event will include the following metadata:  \n`{     \"referenced_tweets\": [         {             \"id\": \"1580559079470145536\"         }     ] }`\n",

All Direct Messages are private and require user authorization to access them.  \nThese Direct Message endpoints require the use of [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/integrate#authentication) or [1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are requesting on behalf of. If you want to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth user-context can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend using a [library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code) allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes, which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user. The Direct Messages lookup endpoints require these scopes: \u00a0dm.write, dm.read, tweet.read, user.read.  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.\n",

To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, rate limits are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThe Manage Direct Message endpoints are rate limited at both the per-user and Twitter App levels. This means that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only send a certain number of messages with your Twitter App. In addition, there is a daily limit on how many Direct Messages can be sent by your Twitter App.  \nThere is a user rate limit of 200 requests/messages per 15 minutes for the POST methods. Users are also limited to 1000 Direct Messages per 24 hours. In addition, Twitter Apps have a limit of 15000 messages per 24 hours. These rate limits are shared across the POST endpoints.\n",

This guide is intended to help understand the differences and provide information for migrating to v2.  \nA major difference between the two versions is that v1.1 supports only one-to-one conversations, while v2 introduces support for group conversations. One artifact of this is that v1.1 supports only \"message created\" events, while v2 also supports events associated with participants joining and leaving conversations. In fact, a fundamental v2 update is establishing dm\\_conversations as a core API object.  \nWith v1.1. there are two endpoints for managing Direct Messages:  \n* [POST direct\\_messages/events/new](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/new-event) \\- Creates a one-to-one Direct Message. This v1.1 endpoint can only create one-to-one messages, and does not support group messages.  \n* [DELETE direct\\_messages/events/destroy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/delete-message-event) - Deletes a one-to-one message from the view of the authenticating user.  \nWith this v2 release, there are three POST methods for creating Direct Messages:  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/with/:participant\\_id/messages** - Creates a one-to-one Direct Message. This method either adds the message to an existing one-to-one conversation or creates a new one. The :participant\\_id path parameter is the User ID of the account receiving the message.  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations** - Creates a new group conversation and adds a Direct Message to it. These requests require a list of conversation participants. Note that you can create multiple conversations with the same participant list. These requests will always return a new conversation ID.  \n* **POST /2/dm\\_conversations/:dm\\_conversation\\_id/messages** - Creates a Direct Message and adds it to an existing conversation. The :dm\\_conversation\\_id path parameter is the ID of the conversation that the message will be added to.  \nAn important detail is that conversation and event IDs are shared across v1.1 and v2 versions of the Twitter Platform. This means both versions can be used together. For example, the Direct Messages v1.1 endpoints provide methods for returning a single event and for deleting events, methods not yet available with v2. Since IDs are common across v1.1 and v2, you can make v1.1 requests based on IDs provided by v2, or by referencing conversation IDs displayed in conversation URLs on the Twitter application.  \nThe following table compares fundamental aspects of the v1.1 and v2 manage Direct Messages endpoints.
