As part of our commitment to a safe, trusted, and professional environment, we provide transparency about government requests for member data and content removal we receive. We believe in free expression and try to minimize the impact of laws that negatively affect constructive, relevant speech.  \nWe respect the laws that apply to us in the countries where we operate. In the U.S., we respond to several types of legal process at the federal, state, and local levels. Most often, we\u2019re responding to search warrants and subpoenas. Outside the U.S., we ask the government that\u2019s requesting information to issue its request properly, for example through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or a form of international process known as a letter rogatory. Sometimes, we\u2019ll make an exception in an emergency. For more information, see our [Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880/linkedin-law-enforcement-data-request-guidelines?lang=en).  \nWe never provide information to a government to fulfill a member data request without first trying to notify the individual member, except when applicable law prohibits us from doing so. We may make exceptions in certain emergencies.  \nThis report covers the six-month period between January 1 and June 30, 2023.\n",

Letters and requests under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), if any.  \n\\[2\\] Subpoenas may be issued for information that is reasonably relevant to the general subject matter of a pending investigation. They are typically pre-signed by a court clerk and are issued by prosecutors without the involvement of a judge.  \n\\[3\\] Search warrants require the government to demonstrate \"probable cause\" and are generally issued by a judge. The standard applicable to a search warrant is higher than that applicable to a subpoena.  \n\\[4\\] Court orders vary depending on the circumstances and the issuing court and jurisdiction. Many of the court orders LinkedIn receives are issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d), a provision of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). To obtain such an order, the government must demonstrate specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing investigation. This standard is higher than that applicable to subpoenas but lower than that applicable to search warrants.  \n\\[5\\] The \"Other\" category includes requests that do not fall within any of the above categories. Examples include emergency requests. As indicated in footnote 1, the category does not include national security-related requests.  \n\\[6\\] In our Government Requests Reports prior to July 2019, we reported on National Security Requests, which could include National Security Letters and FISA requests. In the effort to provide more transparency to our members, we now report NLSs and FISA requests separately. Because we are required by law to delay the release of FISA data by 6 months, reported FISA request metrics correspond to the previous reporting period (for example, data for the July-December 2019 period is reported in our January-June 2020 report).\n",
