When a chargeback occurs, you should retract the in-game item from the costumer where possible as you will not be paid out for this order.<br>* `chargeback_reversal`: A chargeback\\_reversal occurs when a chargeback is retroactively reversed. In this case, you should reinstate the consumer's in-game item if possible as you will now be paid out for this payment.<br>* `decline`: A decline occurs when a funding source used to create a bundled transaction is declined at the moment of processing the payment. You should retract the in-game item from the consumer where possible as you will not be paid out for this order.
