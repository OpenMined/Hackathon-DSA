It's an HTTP-based API that apps can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a wide variety of other tasks.  \nThe Graph API is named after the idea of a \"social graph\" \u2014 a representation of the information on Facebook. It's composed of nodes, edges, and fields. Typically you use nodes to get data about a specific object, use edges to get collections of objects on a single object, and use fields to get data about a single object or each object in a collection. Throughout our documentation, we may refer to both a node and edge as an \"endpoint\". For example, \"send a `GET` request to the User endpoint\".\n",

Because the Graph API is HTTP-based, it works with any language that has an HTTP library, such as cURL and urllib. This means you can use the Graph API directly in your browser. For example, requesting this URL in your browser...  \n[https://graph.facebook.com/facebook/picture?redirect=false](https://graph.facebook.com/facebook/picture?redirect=false)  \n... is equivalent to performing this cURL request:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X GET \"https://graph.facebook.com/facebook/picture?redirect=false\"  \nWe have also enabled the `includeSubdomains` HSTS directive on `facebook.com`, but this should not adversely affect your Graph API calls.  \n[](#)\n",

Almost all Graph API endpoints require an access token of some kind, so each time you access an endpoint, your request may require one. They typically perform two functions:  \n* They allow your app to access a User's information without requiring the User's password. For example, your app needs a User's email to perform a function. If the User agrees to allow your app to retrieve their email address from Facebook, the User will not need to enter their Facebook password for your app to get their email address.\n* They allow us to identify your app, the User who is using your app, and the type of data the User has permitted your app to access.  \nVisit our [access token documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens) to learn more.  \n[](#)\n",

Visit our [Handling Errors guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/guides/error-handling) for more information.  \nYou can usually delete a node, such as a Post or Photo node, by performing a DELETE operation on the object ID:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X DELETE \\\\\n\"https://graph.facebook.com/PHOTO-ID?access\\_token=ACCESSS-TOKEN\"  \nUsually you can only delete nodes that you created, but check each node's reference guide to see requirements for delete operations.  \n[](#)\n",

A cursor refers to a random string of characters which marks a specific item in a list of data. The cursor will always point to the item, however it will be invalidated if the item is deleted or removed. Therefore, your app shouldn't store cursors or assume that they will be valid in the future.  \nWhen reading an edge that supports cursor pagination, you see the following JSON response:  \n{\n\"data\": \\[\n... Endpoint data is here\n\\],\n\"paging\": {\n\"cursors\": {\n\"after\": \"MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=\",\n\"before\": \"NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw\"\n},\n\"previous\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/{your-user-id}/albums?limit=25&before=NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw\"\n\"next\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/{your-user-id}/albums?limit=25&after=MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=\"\n}\n}  \nA cursor-paginated edge supports the following parameters:  \n* `before` : This is the cursor that points to the start of the page of data that has been returned.\n* `after` : This is the cursor that points to the end of the page of data that has been returned.\n* `limit` : This is the maximum number of objects that _may_ be returned. A query may return fewer than the value of `limit` due to filtering. Do not depend on the number of results being fewer than the `limit` value to indicate that your query reached the end of the list of data, use the absence of `next` instead as described below. For example, if you set `limit` to 10 and 9 results are returned, there may be more data available, but one item was removed due to privacy filtering. Some edges may also have a maximum on the `limit` value for performance reasons. In all cases, the API returns the correct pagination links.\n* `next` : The Graph API endpoint that will return the next page of data. If not included, this is the last page of data. Due to how pagination works with visibility and privacy, it is possible that a page may be empty but contain a `next` paging link. Stop paging when the `next` link no longer appears.\n* `previous` : The Graph API endpoint that will return the previous page of data. If not included, this is the first page of data.  \nDon't store cursors. Cursors can quickly become invalid if items are added or deleted.\n",

An app\u2019s call count is the number of calls it can make during a rolling one hour window and is calculated as follows:  \n`Calls within one hour = 200 * Number of Users`  \nThe Number of Users is based on the number of unique daily active users an app has. In cases where there are slow periods of daily usage, such as if your app has high activity on weekends but low activity over weekdays, the weekly and monthly active Users are used to calculate the number of Users for your app. Apps with high daily engagement will have higher rate limits than apps with low daily engagement, regardless of the actual number of app installs.  \nNote that this is not a per User limit but a limit on calls made by your app. Any individual User can make more than 200 calls per hour using your app, as long as the total calls from your app does not exceed the app maximum. For example, if your app has 100 Users, your app can make 20,000 calls per hour. However, your top ten most engaged Users could make 19,000 of those calls.\n",

For example, a user could make X calls through App1 and Y calls through App2. If X+Y exceeds the user\u2019s call count that user will be rate limited.

For example, you can make a single API request specifying multiple IDs, but each ID counts as one API call.  \nThe following table illustrates this concept.  \n| Example Request(s) | Number of API Calls |\n| --- | --- |\n| `GET https://graph.facebook.com/photos?ids=4`<br><br>`GET https://graph.facebook.com/photos?ids=5`<br><br>`GET https://graph.facebook.com/photos?ids=6` | 3   |\n| `GET https://graph.facebook.com/photos?ids=4,5,6` | 3   |  \nWe strongly recommend specifying multiple IDs in one API request when possible, as this improves performance of your API responses.  \n#### I'm building a scraper, is there anything else I should worry about?  \nIf you are building a service that scrapes data, please read [our scraping terms](https://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos_terms.php?hc_location=ufi).  \n[](#)  \n[](#)\n",

Here is a timeline example:  \n![](https://scontent-cdg4-3.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/10333112_605697729514600_969655318_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_ohc=saSXtnTXdQkAX_aXEBr&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-3.xx&stp=dst-emg0_q75&ur=34156e&_nc_sid=a284aa&oh=00_AfAlaCEeCem6W5wbLhbnVTJWyW9ij4GhQ9GBhgzq7wPdrQ&oe=65B4388B)  \nFor SDKs, a version will always remain available as it is a downloadable package.

For example, let's say the current version is v4.0. The call is as follows:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X \"https://graph.facebook.com/v4.0/{my-user-id}&access\\_token={access-token}\"  \nThe same unversioned call is as follows:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X \"https://graph.facebook.com/{my-user-id}&access\\_token={access-token}\"  \nAn unversioned call uses the version set in the app dashboard **Upgrade API Version** card under **Settings > Advanced**. In following example, the version set in the app dashboard is v2.10 and the unversioned call is equivalent to:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X \"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/{my-user-id}&access\\_token={access-token}\"  \nWe recommend you always specify the version where possible.  \n#### Limitations  \n* You can not make unversioned API calls to the Facebook JavaScript SDK.\n",

For example, if you're making calls without a version specified, the API version that responds may not be known to you.  \nThe Graph API supplies a request header with any response called `facebook-api-version` that indicates the exact version of the API that generated the response. For example, a Graph API call that generates a request with v2.0 produces the following HTTP header:  \nfacebook\\-api\\-version:v2.0  \nThis `facebook-api-version` header allows you to determine whether API calls are being returned from the version that you expect.\n",

To limit results, add a `.limit()` argument to any field or edge.  \nFor example, performing a GET request on your `/feed` edge may return hundreds of Posts. You can limit the number of Posts returned for each page of results by doing this:  \ncurl \\-i \\-X GET \"https://graph.facebook.com/USER-ID?fields=feed.limit(3)&access\\_token=ACCESS-TOKEN\"  \nThis returns all of the Posts on your User node, but limits the number of objects in each page of results to three. Notice that instead of specifying the Feed edge in the path URL (`/user/feed`), you specify it in the `fields` parameter (`?fields=feed`), which allows you to append the `.limit(3)` argument.  \nHere are the query results:  \n{\n\"feed\": {\n\"data\": \\[\n{\n\"created\\_time\": \"2021-12-12T01:24:21+0000\",\n\"message\": \"This picture of my grandson with Santa\",\n\"id\": \"POST-ID\"\n},\n{\n\"created\\_time\": \"2021-12-11T23:40:17+0000\",\n\"message\": \":)\",\n\"id\": \"POST-ID\"\n},\n{\n\"created\\_time\": \"2021-12-11T23:31:38+0000\",\n\"message\": \"Thought you might enjoy this.\",\n\"id\": \"POST-ID\"\n}\n\\],\n\"paging\": {\n\"previous\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/USER-ID/feed?format=json&limit=3&since=1542820440&access\\_token=ACCESS-TOKEN&\\_\\_paging\\_token=enc\\_AdC...&\\_\\_previous=1\",\n\"next\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/USER-ID/feed?format=json&limit=3&access\\_token=ACCESS-TOKEN&until=1542583212&\\_\\_paging\\_token=enc\\_AdD...\"\n}\n},\n\"id\": \"USER-ID\"\n}  \nAs you can see, only three objects appear in this page of paginated results.

For example, in a single call, you can ask for the first N photos of the first K albums. The response maintains the data hierarchy so developers do not have to weave the data together on the client. This is different from the [batch requests](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/making-multiple-requests/) feature which allows you to make multiple, potentially unrelated, Graph API calls in a single request.  \nHere is the general format that field expansion takes:  \nGET graph.facebook.com/{node\\-id}?fields\\=LEVEL\\-ONE{LEVEL\\-TWO}  \n`LEVEL-ONE` in this case would be one or more (comma-separated) fields or edges from the parent node. `LEVEL-TWO` would be one or more (comma-separated) fields or edges from the first level node.  \nThere is no limitation to the amount of nesting of levels that can occur here. You can also use a `.limit(n)` argument on each field or edge to restrict how many objects you want to get.  \nThis is easier to understand by seeing it in action, so here's an example query that will retrieve up to five posts your published, with the text from each individual post.  \nGET graph.facebook.com/me?fields\\=posts.limit(5){message}  \nWe can then extend this a bit more and for each post object, we get the text and privacy setting of each post. By default the `privacy` field returns an object that contains information about five key:value pairs, `allow`, `deny`, `description`, `friends`, and `value`. In this query we only want one returned, the `value` key:value pair.  \nGET graph.facebook.com/me?fields\\=posts.limit(5){message,privacy{value}}  \nNow we can extend it again by retrieving the name of each photo, the picture URL, and the people tagged:  \nGET graph.facebook.com\n/me?fields\\=albums.limit(5){name, photos.limit(2){name, picture, tags.limit(2)}},posts.limit(5)  \nLet's look at an example using cursor-based pagination:  \nGET graph.facebook.com\n/me?fields\\=albums.limit(5){name,photos.limit(2).after(MTAyMTE1OTQwNDc2MDAxNDkZD){name,picture,tags.limit(2)}},posts.limit(5)  \nYou can see how field expansion can work across nodes, edges, and fields to return really complex data in a single request.  \n#### Limitations  \n* Certain resources, including most of Marketing API, are unable to utilize field expansion on some or all connections.  \n[](#)\n",

This will return data using fields that you already have in your application logic.  \nFor example, you can retrieve an image in two sizes and alias the returned object fields as `picture_small` and `picture_larger`:  \nme?fields\\=id,name,picture.width(100).height(100).as(picture\\_small),picture.width(720).height(720).as(picture\\_large)  \nOn success, Graph API returns this result:  \n{\n\"id\": \"993363923726\",\n\"name\": \"Benjamin Golub\",\n\"picture\\_small\": {\n\"data\": {\n\"height\": 100,\n\"is\\_silhouette\": false,\n\"url\": \"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xft1/v/t1.0-1/p100x100/11700890\\_10100330450676146\\_2622493406845121288\\_n.jpg?oh=82b9abe469c78486645783c9e70e8797&amp;oe=561D10AE&amp;\\_\\_gda\\_\\_=1444247939\\_661c0f48363f1d1a7d42b6f836687a04\",\n\"width\": 100\n}\n},\n\"picture\\_large\": {\n\"data\": {\n\"height\": 720,\n\"is\\_silhouette\": false,\n\"url\": \"https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xft1/v/t1.0-1/11700890\\_10100330450676146\\_2622493406845121288\\_n.jpg?oh=dd86551faa2de0cd6b359feb5665b0a5&amp;oe=561E0B46&amp;\\_\\_gda\\_\\_=1443979219\\_f1abbbdfb0fb7dac361d7ae02b460638\",\n\"width\": 720\n}\n}\n}  \nPlease note that not all nodes and edges support field aliasing. Endpoints that do not support aliasing will return an error. For example, the `User` node does not support aliasing, so if you tried to alias the `name` field as `my_name` you would receive an error like this:  \n{\n\"error\": {\n\"message\": \"(#100) Unknown fields: my\\_name.\",\n\"type\": \"OAuthException\",\n\"code\": 100\n}\n}  \n[](#)\n",

It's possible to take an access token generated on a client by Meta's SDK, send it to a server and then make calls from that server on behalf of the client. An access token can also be stolen by malicious software on a person's computer or a man in the middle attack. Then that access token can be used from an entirely different system that's not the client and not your server, generating spam or stealing data.  \nCalls from a server can be better secured by adding a parameter called `appsecret_proof`. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key. The app secret can be found in your app dashboard in **Settings > Basic**.  \nIf you're using the official PHP SDK, the `appsecret_proof` parameter is automatically added.\n",
