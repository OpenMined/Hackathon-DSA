For a simpler research solution, you may want to start with our [Ad Library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/).To search for all ads currently running across Meta technologies, please use the [Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?ad_type=political_and_issue_ads).  \nReady to get started?To get authorized to use the API, you'll need a Facebook account.  \nStep 1: Confirm your identity and locationGo to [Facebook.com/ID](https://www.facebook.com/ID) and follow the confirmation process required to run ads about social issues, elections or politics. It can take a few days to confirm the information you submit.  \nStep 2: Create a Meta for Developers accountVisit [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and select **Get Started**.
