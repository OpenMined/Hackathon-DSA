This is for [EU DSA Article 24(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2065#d1e3117-1-1) purposes.  \nIt is based on our existing data collected about visits to our sites: unique device counts (see also: [WikiStats](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects/reading/unique-devices/normal%7Cline%7C2-year%7C(access-site)~mobile-site*desktop-site%7Cdaily)). **No new data is collected from visitors** in order to produce this table. It is based on reasonable estimations that the \"average\" EU visitor to our projects will use more than one machine that we detect as a Unique Device. This conversion factor may evolve according to changing internet usage patterns and survey methodologies. The table includes the conversion factor used in a given period, together with notes and/or citations.  \nFor important information about our Unique Device counting methodology - including how we attempt to discount bots - see [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Unique_devices \"metawiki:Research:Unique devices\"), [here](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Traffic/Unique_Devices/Last_access_solution \"wikitech:Analytics/Data Lake/Traffic/Unique Devices/Last access solution\") and [here](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/ \"wmfblog:2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/\"). Significant, observed anomalies are logged [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Config:Dashiki:Annotations/Wikistats/uniqueDevices).  \nThe table does not include minisites that serve a primarily technical or organizational role (with limited audiences), rather than general audiences. Examples of these include chapter and usergroup pages, API Portal, Meta, Wikiversity Beta, sites dedicated to Wikimania events, Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki, Wikimedia Incubator, Wikitech, MediaWiki, and Phabricator. For the full range of sites for which data like this could be obtained upon request, see the \"Wiki\" dropdown on [this page](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects/reading/unique-devices/normal%7Cline%7C2-year%7C(access-site)~mobile-site*desktop-site%7Cmonthly).  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |Average monthly active recipients of the service, in the EU region over prior 6 months (est.)\n|     | Aug. 2022 - Jan. 2023 | Feb. 2023 - July 2023 |\n| Wikibooks | 6,919,000 | 1,611,000 |\n| Wikidata | 1,056,000 | 1,051,000 |\n| Wikimedia Commons | 2,845,000 | 3,272,000 |\n| Wikinews | 6,283,000 | 1,035,000 |\n| Wikipedia | **151,556,000** | **151,088,000** |\n| Wikiquote | 6,811,000 | 1,548,000 |\n| Wikisource | 7,106,000 | 1,845,000 |\n| Wikispecies | 29,000 | 37,000 |\n| Wikiversity | 6,360,000 | 1,082,000 |\n| Wikivoyage | 616,000 | 632,000 |\n| Wiktionary | 8,955,000 | 8,425,000 |\n|     | 2.4[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-Cisco-1) | 2.4[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-Cisco-1) |  \nFurther general remarks:  \n1. These estimates have been rounded to the nearest '000 (e.g. '1499' rounds to '1000'. '1500' rounds up to '2000').\n2. Device geolocation is generally inaccurate. For example, some users living in non-EU countries may be using [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network \"en:Virtual private network\") to the EU, in order to avoid local surveillance and/or censorship. The converse may also be true.\n3. The \"Est. devices per person\" factor for the period Aug. 2022- Jan. 2023 is conservative. It uses the Global \"devices per person\" value provided by its source[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-Cisco-1) for 2018; it does not use the (larger) devices-per-person estimates provided for 2023 (global: 3.6), nor estimates given for Europe specifically (**2018**: range 2.5 - 5.6; **2023** (est.): range 4.0 - 9.5). This is due to uncertainty regarding the impact of Internet-connected devices that cannot be used with our projects (e.g. some IoT devices), or device sharing (e.g. within households or libraries). The Wikimedia Foundation reserves the right to update its methodology at any time, including to adopt less conservative approaches to conversion factor selection.\n4. For convenience, data on this page is not currently broken out by language. However, exactly what qualifies as a \"service\" or \"platform\" for EU DSA purposes is unclear. The current presentation of this data - grouping languages together for immediate convenience - is strictly without prejudice regarding such questions.\n5. We have observed a trend with data over a 5-year period, where we see a seasonal decline in the first half of the year, in Unique Devices for smaller project families such as Wikisource, Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikiversity and Wikinews. See, for example, [this chart showing seasonal spikes in Wikiquote's Unique Device statistics](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-wikiquote-projects/reading/unique-devices/normal%7Cline%7C2016-01-01~2023-09-01%7C(access-site)~mobile-site*desktop-site%7Cmonthly).\n",
