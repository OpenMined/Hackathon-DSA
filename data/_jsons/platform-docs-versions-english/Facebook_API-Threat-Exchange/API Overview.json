Today, ThreatExchange (aka TX or TE) is used by multiple companies to share signals on a variety of topics intended to prevent real world harm. Some examples of how TX is currently used include sharing malware, phishing scams, and terrorism signals with the goal of helping all participating organizations tackle these problems based on their terms of service.  \nThreatExchange is built on these core concepts:  \n* [Signals (aka ThreatIndicators)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator/)\n* [Opinions about signals (aka ThreatDescriptors)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptor/)\n* [Who can see signals (aka Privacy)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/privacy)  \nThese concepts allow a group of ThreatExchange members to share signals, [react to](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/reacting) and describe signals other members upload, and decide individually on how a signal aligns with their policies.\n",

Platforms help each other by sharing signals from content that they found and labeled on their platform. For example, Platform A might find a video of terrorism on their platform. By sharing the hash of that video (a type of signal) with Platform B, Platform B can find and review that video, which they might have otherwise missed. By sharing signals, the platforms can compound their individual trust & safety efforts and prevent more harm faster.  \nSignal Sharing is **not** a way for platforms to align on content policies or to coordinate on what content they remove. Each platform reviews content independently according to its own community standards policies and takes actions according to those standards.\n",

Signal sharing on ThreatExchange tries to reduce this harm by helping platforms find and remove more harmful content. Platforms come in all shapes and sizes, and not all can afford to hire a myriad of reviewers or invest millions in specialized machine learning models. For these platforms, investing in ThreatExchange can be an effective way to use their trust and safety resources.  \nEven for platform\u2019s which already have robust trust and safety programs, there are still tangible benefits to joining and contributing to ThreatExchange. Namely, the harmful content found on those platform often doesn\u2019t go away, it just goes somewhere else. A rising tide lifts all boats, and by all pitching in, we can improve the baseline safety level for the entire internet. Even if you aren\u2019t uploading new signals to ThreatExchange simply confirming (or disputing!) labels will improve that baseline, build trust in our platforms, and help make the internet safer.\n",

This is the best place to quickly explore the data in ThreatExchange. Learn more about [ThreatExchange](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/ui).  \n* **Python**: To build an inital integration and to preform validation we recommend using the python [open source library](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffacebook%2FThreatExchange%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fpython-threatexchange&h=AT22unYY_pituBKadb-EScGZerV-EGeuF0oO9hKHtPwHvOFrpmfoaj66Y_6kMzgy4BLmKbBpWFMxWhC5lQ2JgJjgTW6XgLHoACcmcqSTnJk6c158Te8KQBvdu7VOihUi1gIUJ2fS12bBXHyUJpc1CeNcuJpLSQ) we\u2019ve developed. This allows you fetch a copy of shared signals in a simple format.  \n* **API**: Lastly, there is also a powerful HTTP API which has greater functionality than the python wrapper for an advanced integration. Learn more about these [APIs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis).  \nTo use any of these methods you will first need to get access to ThreatExchange. ThreatExchange requires you (or someone on your team) to have a Facebook account, or to create one, and then will require creating a new application. Afterwards, you can apply for access to ThreatExchange, which requires you to confirm that your application belongs to your business. After that, you can add more accounts to the application, or store a token to gain access to the API.  \nFollow [these steps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/ui/app-review) to create an App and get access to ThreatExchange.\n",

One uses \"business accounts\", and the other is for an admin to directly add a personal account to the application. Using the business account allows you to separate your work and personal usage more cleanly. Learn more about adding people to a business account [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706). From [business.facebook.com/settings/people/](https://business.facebook.com/settings/people/) for your business, you can invite people to your business.  \n3) Using the person's work email, invite them to your business account. You don't need to give them any permissions at this point.  \nAs of July 2023, this is what the \"Add Person\" flow looks like:  \nYou'll be leaving all the defaults and not assigning any permissions at this stage.  \n4) After the person has accepted the invite, you can then assign them to the ThreatExchange Application:  \nYou'll need to assign at least at the \"Develop App\" level, but \"Manage App\" can also simplify fixing settings.  \nNext, learn about [Best Practices for Using ThreatExchange](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/best-practices).\n",

For example, app ID 1064060413755420 is Media Hash Sharing Test. These are generally of the form _Team T at company C_.  \n* When people share threat data, they can specify who they want to see each datum. This is referred to as a **visibility** or **privacy type**.  \n* _Visible/public_ means all ThreatExchange members can see it.  \n* Or, for each datum the members can create an app-whitelist of specific teams at specific companies.  \n* Or, for each datum the members can specify a privacy-group that is simply a predefined list of app IDs.  \n* People can [**tag**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threattags) their descriptors. These are tags in any other tool, except that ThreatExchange tags have their own metadata, including the subjective parts that descriptors have, and they also have their own visiblity (public/app-whitelist/privacy-group).  \n* There's more about threat descriptors ([review status](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/review-status-type) and [others](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis)) and other types of data shareable on ThreatExchange.

It is recommended to review the [Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api), as it covers key concepts: usage of access tokens for authentication, result pagination, and batching.  \nThe ThreatExchange APIs are made up of various [objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis) and each object can have connections to other objects. For instance, a threat indicator is an object that can be connected to other threat indicators.  \nThreatExchange also allows for multiple members to share the same threat indicator. Because there is the potential for a collision, we separate each member's submission into distinct [ThreatDescriptor](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptor) objects, which are connected to their respective [ThreatIndicator](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator)\n",

After you have [authenticated](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/getting-started), try some calls with the [`threat_indicator`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator) object.**  \nTo ensure consistency, the ThreatExchange APIs and its consumers use JSON objects as their default currency. Using these APIs gives you a lot of things for free:  \n* Field validation  \n* Type checking  \n* Persistence to Facebook's Graph  \n* Everyone else can use what you share and be better protected!  \nAll objects are formatted as maps using a predefined set of field names, with expected value types. They can be of arbitrary size and field order in the map is, generally, not important.\n",
