Learn more about these metadata on the [\"Edit Tweets\" fundamentals page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/edit-tweets).  \nThis endpoint is often used with the Direct Messages endpoints. We have launched new [v2 Direct Messages endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/direct-messages/manage/introduction). Note that the Enterprise and Premium Account Activity APIs support v2 one-to-one messages, but do not yet support group conversations.  \nOverview  \n-----------  \nEnterprise  \nThe Account Activity API provides you the ability to subscribe to realtime activities related to a user account via webhooks. This means that you can receive\u00a0realtime Tweets, Direct Messages, and other account events from one or more of your owned or subscribed accounts through a single connection.  \nYou will receive all related activities below for each user subscription on your webhook registration:  \n| Activity types |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Tweets (by user)  <br>    <br>* Tweet deletes (by user)<br>* @mentions (of user)<br>* Replies (to or from user)<br>* Retweets (by user or of user)<br>* Quote Tweets (by user or of user)<br>* Retweets of Quoted Tweets (by user or of user)<br>* Likes (by user or of user)<br>* Follows (by user or of user)  <br>    <br>* Unfollows (by user) | * Blocks (by user)<br>* Unblocks (by user)<br>* Mutes (by user)<br>* Unmutes (by user)<br>* Direct Messages sent (by user)<br>* Direct Messages received (by user)<br>* Typing indicators (to user)<br>* Read receipts (to user)<br>* Subscription revokes (by user) |  \n**Please note** - We do not deliver home timeline data via the Account Activity API.

This is the endpoint deployed on your server to listen for incoming Twitter webhook events.\n* The URI\u00a0_path_\u00a0is completely up to you. This example would be valid: https://mydomain.com_/service/listen_  \n* If you are listening for webhooks from a variety of sources, a common pattern is: https://mydomain.com/webhook/twitter\n* Note that the specified URL can not include a port specification (https://mydomain.com:5000/NoWorkie).\n* As described in our\u00a0[Securing Webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/securing-webhooks)\u00a0guide, a first step is writing code that receives a Twitter Challenge Response Check (CRC) GET request and responds with a properly formatted JSON response.\n* Register your webhook URL. You will make a POST request to a\u00a0/webhooks.json?url= endpoint. When you make this request Twitter will issue a CRC request to your web app. When a webhook is successfully registered, the response will include a webhook\u00a0id. This webhook\u00a0id\u00a0is needed later when making some requests to the Account Activity API.  \n* Twitter will send account webhook events to the URL you registered. Make sure your web app supports POST requests for incoming events. These events will be encoded in JSON. See\u00a0[HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/account-activity-data-objects) for example webhook JSON payloads.\n* Once your web app is ready, the next step is adding accounts to receive activities for. When adding (or deleting) accounts you will make POST requests referencing the account id.

When a CRC is sent, Twitter will make a GET request of your web app with a ;_`crc_token`_ parameter. When that request is received, your web app needs to build an encrypted `response_token` based on the _`crc_token`_\u00a0parameter and your app's Consumer Secret (details below). The response\\_token must be encoded in JSON (see example\u00a0below) and returned within three seconds. When successful, a webhook `id` will be returned.  \nA CRC will be sent when you register your webhook URL, so implementing your CRC response code is a fundamental first step. Once your webhook is established, Twitter will trigger a CRC roughly every 24 hours from the last time we received a successful response. Your app can also trigger a CRC when needed by making a PUT request with your webhook `id`. Triggering a CRC is useful as you develop your webhook application, after deploying new code and restarting your service.  \nThe\u00a0_`crc_token`_\u00a0should be expected to change for each incoming CRC request and\u00a0should be used as the message in the calculation, where your Consumer Secret is the key.  \nIn the event that the response is not posted within 3 seconds or becomes invalid, events will cease to be sent to the registered webhook.  \n#### The CRC request will occur:  \n* When a webhook URL is registered.\n* Approximately _hourly_ to validate your webhook URL.\n* You can manually trigger a CRC by making a PUT request. As you develop your webhook client, you should plan on manually triggering the CRC as you develop your CRC response.  \n#### Response requirements:  \n* A base64 encoded HMAC SHA-256 hash created from the `crc_token` and your app Consumer Secret\n* Valid response\\_token and JSON format.\n* Latency less than 3 seconds.\n* 200 HTTP response code.  \n#### Language-specific HMAC libraries:  \n* [Java/Scala](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?javax/crypto/Mac.html)\n* [Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/HMAC.html)\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_hmac)\n* [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/hmac.html)  \n#### Example response token generation in Python:  \nThe following defines a route in a Python 2.7\u00a0Flask\u00a0webapp that will respond to the challenge response check correctly.  \nimport base64\nimport hashlib\nimport hmac\nimport json\n",

If a 'success' 200 HTTP response code is not received, the Twitter server will initiate a retry mechanism, resending the webhook event up to three times over a five-minute period. This webhook event retry service helps provide reliability and event recovery when network\u00a0problems occur and during client-side service interruptions and deploys.\n",

When the client-side does not confirm the successful receipt of an event, Twitter assumes the event was not received. If a\u00a0non-200 response is received, a response isn't received within three seconds, or we don't receive a response at all,\u00a0we retry the request and leave that open for three seconds. This means that you have roughly five seconds over two attempts to respond to receive the activity that we are trying to send to your webhook URL. In the event that your server doesn't response or returns a transient error, we will retry for five minutes. There will be a total of three retry attempts to confirm validation. This allows redundancy and insurance that you receive all webhook events. Note that subscriptions with retries will get retried events for any/all activities for all subscribed users on their webhook.  \nIf you do not confirm validation within these eight attempts, the activity will no longer be available via the Account Activity API.\n",

It should be utilized to recover data in scenarios where your [webhook](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise) server misses events, -- whether due to disconnections lasting longer than the [retry window](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/activity-retries), or for those disaster recovery scenarios where you need a few days to restore your system back to normal.  \nThe Account Activity Replay API was developed for any scenario where you fail to ingest [activities](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/overview) for a period of time. It delivers activities to the same webhook used for the original real-time delivery of activities. This product is a recovery tool and not a backfill tool, which means events will only be replayed if a previous delivery of them was attempted. The Account Activity Replay API cannot deliver events for a time period prior to a subscription\u2019s creation time.\n",

It is important to note that your request must specify a webhook id parameter to indicate which webhook\u2019s activities you would like to replay. In other words, a Replay request asks Account Activity Replay API to retrieve events from a start date and time to an end date and time based on the webhook id and application id.  \nPlease note that UTC time is expected. These activities are delivered through the registered webhook associated with the id at a rate of up to 2,500 events per second. Also keep in mind that only one Replay job per webhook may be running at a time, although all subscriptions that were active during the date/time specified on that webhook will be replayed.  \nEvents are delivered beginning with the first (oldest) minute of the specified time period, continuing chronologically (as best as possible) until the final minute is delivered. At that point, Replay will deliver a [job completion event](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/replay-api#job-completed-successfully-message) to the webhook. Because we work chronologically in delivering activities, if there are little or no matching results near the start time, there will likely be a period of time before the first results are delivered.\n",

For example, if three days ago, you added a new subscription and ran a Replay job with a window for five days prior to today, you would only receive data for the three days that this new subscription was active.\n",

You will be able to make requests specifying a timeframe within this five day window using the from\\_date and to\\_date parameters within the request. Events that were originally delivered prior to having access to Replay cannot be replayed. For example, if your account was enabled for access to the Account Activity Replay API on June 1, 2019 at 3:30PM UTC, you would not be able to use Replay to retrieve any events prior to that date and time.  \nContinue to the [Account Activity Replay API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/replay-api)  \nMigration introduction\n",

You will need to alter your web app to receive data with webhooks. You can find more information on webhooks [here](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks).  \n**Data Available:** Another key difference you will notice is in regards to the data being delivered. Twitter will no longer send events from people that you follow on Twitter (aka your home timeline). This was an intentional change and is not something we plan to alter going forward.  \n**Reliability:** Unlike streaming, webhooks enable confirmation of delivery and options to retry POSTed activities that do not make it to the webhook URL.\u00a0 This gives more assurance that the app is receiving all applicable activities, even if there are brief disconnections or periods of downtime.\n",

Webhooks offer many benefits compared to streaming, but the most prominent are speed and reliability. The API will send you data in the form of JSON events as they become available and you will no longer need to maintain an active connection or poll the endpoint. This limits the need for redundancy features and increases efficiency overall.

If a user has not already given you read, write and direct message access, you will need to have that user re-authorize your application.\n* If you are unfamiliar with [Twitter Sign-in](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter) and how user contexts work with the Twitter API review [Obtaining Access Tokens](https://dev.twitter.com/webhooks/access-tokens).\n* Generate access tokens for the Twitter app owner at the bottom of the \u201cKeys and Tokens\u201d tab. On this same tab take note of your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret. You will need these to use the API.\n* Generate a bearer token using your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret for [application-only](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only) API methods.  \n**Step 3: Setup & Configure Your Webhooks**  \n* Create a web app with an endpoint to use as your webhook to receive events (e.g.\u00a0https://your\\_domain.com/webhook/twitter\u00a0or https://webhooks.your\\_domain.com).\n* Use your\u00a0Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret when creating your webhook, Note that your endpoint must return a JSON response with a\u00a0response\\_token\u00a0that is a base64 encoded HMAC SHA-256 hash created from the\u00a0crc\\_token\u00a0and your app Consumer Secret.  \n* Review [Securing Webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/securing-webhooks) documentation taking special note of the Challenge Response Check (CRC) requirements.\n* Make sure your webhook supports POST requests for incoming events and GET requests for the CRC.\n* Make sure your webhook has low latency (<3 seconds to respond to POST requests)  \n**Step 4: Validate Your Webhook Setup**  \n* Webhook APIs will secure your webhooks in two ways:  \n- Require challenge response checks to validate that the webhook owner is the web app owner.  \n- A signature header in each POST request for your web app to validate the source.  \n* In order to verify that you are both the owner of the web app and the webhook URL, Twitter will perform a Challenge Response Check (CRC), which is not to be confused with a cyclic redundancy check.\n* A GET request with a parameter named crc\\_token will be sent to your webhook URL. Your endpoint must return a JSON response with a response\\_token that is a base64 encoded HMAC SHA-256 hash created from the crc\\_token and your app Consumer Secret.\n* The crc\\_token should be expected to change for each incoming CRC request. The crc\\_token should be used as the message in the calculation, where your Consumer Secret is the key.\n* In the event that the response is invalid, events will cease to be sent to the registered webhook.  \n**Step 5: Create Subscriptions for Each User Stream or Site Streams Authorized User**  \nConverting to the Account Activity API from User Streams:  \n* Generate a list of your current user subscriptions on User Streams\n* Set up your new Account Activity API subscriptions using the request:\u00a0\u00a0_POST account\\_activity/all/:env\\_name/subscriptions_\n* Confirm your Account Activity API subscriptions using the request:\u00a0\u00a0_GET account\\_activity/all/:env\\_name/subscriptions/list_  \nConverting to the Account Activity API from Site Streams:\u00a0(using control streams):  \n* Generate a list of your current subscriptions on Site Streams using the request:\u00a0\u00a0_GET /1.1/site/c/:stream\\_id/info.json_\n* Set up your new Account Activity API subscriptions using the request:\u00a0\u00a0_POST account\\_activity/all/:env\\_name/subscriptions_\n* Confirm your Account Activity API subscriptions using the request:\u00a0\u00a0_GET account\\_activity/all/:env\\_name/subscriptions/list_  \nRegistering a Webhook and Creating Subscriptions (not migrating from Site Streams or User Streams)  \n* Register your webhook URL with your app using\u00a0[POST webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise#post-account-activity-webhooks)\u00a0and receive a webhook\\_id.\n* Use the returned webhook\\_id to add user subscriptions with\u00a0[POST webhooks/:webhook\\_id/subscriptions/all](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise#post-account-activity-webhooks-webhook-id-subscriptions-all).\n",

Simply updating the endpoint URLs will result in errors in your application. Consider the following when updating your application for the migration.  \n#### New Direct Message object  \nThe first thing you are likely to notice is the new object structure of Direct Messages. This new Message Create object structure has been introduced to support new capabilities like [Quick Replies](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/quick-replies) and [Attachments](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/message-attachments). The new object also contains a smaller condensed user object. Your application will need to be updated to account for this new object structure when parsing and potentially in data models or storage. For descriptions of each property see the [full documentation on the Message Create Object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/guides/message-create-object).  \n**Example message create object**  \n{\n\"type\": \"message_create\",\n\"id\": \"1234858592\",\n\"created_timestamp\": \"1392078023603\",\n\"initiated_via\": {\n\"tweet_id\": \"123456\",\n\"welcome_message_id\": \"456789\"\n},\n\"message_create\": {\n\"target\": {\n\"recipient_id\": \"1234858592\"\n},\n\"sender_id\": \"3805104374\",\n\"source_app_id\": \"268278\",\n\"message_data\": {\n\"text\": \"Blue Bird\",\n\"entities\": {\n\"hashtags\": [],\n\"symbols\": [],\n\"urls\": [],\n\"user_mentions\": [],\n},\n\"quick_reply_response\": {\n\"type\": \"options\",\n\"metadata\": \"external_id_2\"\n},\n\"attachment\": {\n\"type\": \"media\",\n\"media\": {\n...\n}\n}\n}\n}  \n#### Summary  \n* Entirely new Direct Message object structure.\n* Condensed user object.\n* New information provided (quick reply responses, attachments, etc).\n",

The most significant difference with this endpoint is that all information is now sent as JSON in the POST request body as opposed to individual POST params.  \n**Example Twurl request**  \ntwurl -A 'Content-type: application/json' -X POST /1.1/direct\\_messages/events/new.json -d '{\"event\": {\"type\": \"message\\_create\", \"message\\_create\": {\"target\": {\"recipient\\_id\": \"4534871\"}, \"message\\_data\": {\"text\": \"Hello World!\"}}}}'  \nNote in the above request that the content-type is set to application/json as opposed to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Additionally, if you are constructing the OAuth 1.0a signature, note that the JSON body is not included in the generation of the signature. Most OAuth libraries already account for this. If you are using [twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl), ensure you are using at least version 0.9.3.  \n#### Summary  \n* Message is defined in JSON POST body\n* Content-type header must be set to application/json\n* JSON body is not included in the generation of the OAuth signature.\n",

        "content": "Source document: data/platform-docs-versions-english/X_Twitter-API-Enterprise/Account Activity API.md\nParagraph location: \n\treturns properly formatted json response\n\tDirect Message migration guide\n\tRetrieving Direct Messages\n\nContent: \n### Retrieving Direct Messages  \nRetrieving past Direct Message is now accomplished with a single API endpoint: [GET direct\\_messages/events/list](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/list-events). The significant difference with this new endpoint is that it now returns both sent and received messages in reverse chronological order. This may make it easier to rebuild a conversation. However, if you are only looking for sent or received messages you will need to post-process the response by referring to the sender\\_id property.  \nPagination is now based on a cursor value rather an ID of a Direct Message. A cursor property is returned with each response. [GET direct\\_messages/events/list](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/list-events) will return up to 30 days of past messages, regardless of how many messages exist within the past 30 days. When a cursor is not returned, there are no more messages to be returned. The method for accessing individual Direct Messages with [GET direct\\_messages/events/show](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/get-event) remains the same, although the Direct Message object returned has a different structure as described previously.  \nFinally, real-time access to Direct Messages will now be accomplished via webhook with the [Account Activity API](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/overview). For guidance in migrating from User Streams or Site Streams, see the migration guide to Account Activity API for more information.  \n#### Summary  \n* Sent and Received messages are now returned on the same endpoint.\n* Up to 30 days of messages returned.\n* Cursor based pagination.\n* Real-time access to Direct Message via webhook.\n",

The interface is largely the same requiring the ID of the message to delete. The key differences is the endpoint now requires a DELETE request instead of a POST request.  \nHow deleted Direct Messages are reflected in official Twitter clients remains the same. Direct Messages are only removed from the interface of the user context provided. Other members of the conversation can still access the Direct Message.  \n#### Summary  \n* Deleting a Direct Message requires the ID.\n* New endpoint requires a DELETE request.\n* How deleted Direct Messages are reflected in official Twitter clients remains unchanged.  \n**Questions about migrating to the new Direct Message endpoints?\n**Post your question to the developer community forum on [twittercommunity.com](https://twittercommunity.com/tags/c/rest-api/rest-api-v1-1/directmessages).\n",

Webhooks are also different from Rest APIs because you don't have to pull us hundreds of times every 15 minutes to get the data you care about. This increases the efficiency between a user and your app, as it delivers data when it happens.  \nThe Account Activity API has a number of benefits:  \n1. **Speed**: we deliver data at the speed of Twitter.\n2. **Simplicity**: we deliver all of an account's events, through one single webhook connection. The activities delivered in the API include Tweets, @mentions, replies, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Retweets of Quote Tweets, favorites, Direct Messages sent, Direct Messages received, follows, blocks, mutes.\n3. **Scale**: you receive all of the activities for an account that you manage without being restricted by any rate limits of event caps.  \nThe Account Activity API is available as a premium sandbox, premium paid, and enterprise offering, so you can scale as you require more accounts for liability features or additional functionality.  \nTo get started, visit the [playbook](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/customer-engagement-application-playbook)\u00a0or download sample code snippets from [GitHub](https://github.com/twitterdev/account-activity-dashboard).  \n**How do I identify which product tier is best for me?**  \nPlease read through our [Account Activity API Overview](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/overview) page to learn more about the differences between the Premium options and the Enterprise option.  \n**What is the difference between a Premium environment and an Enterprise webhook?**  \nThere is no difference. Each Premium environment will have its own webhook\\_id.  \n**I need a development, staging and production environment for Account Activity API, is this possible?**  \nYes! With the paid tiers of Account Activity API (Paid Premium and Enterprise), it's possible to register multiple webhook URLs and manage subscriptions separately for each through the API methods. Additionally, multiple client apps may be added to an allowlist to maintain authorization for your current authorized users.  \n**Do you have any step-by-step guides on how to get set up with the Account Activity API?**  \nAs a matter of fact, we do!  \n* If you are just getting started, we recommend that you visit our [Getting started with webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks) guide  \n* Follow along with our Twitter Dev supported scripts:\n* [Account Activity API dashboard](https://github.com/twitterdev/account-activity-dashboard), a node web app that displays webhook events.\n* The\u00a0[SnowBot chatbot](https://github.com/twitterdev/SnowBotDev), a Ruby web app built on the Account Activity and Direct Message APIs. This code base includes a\u00a0[script](https://github.com/twitterdev/SnowBotDev/wiki/Account-Activity-API-setup-script)\u00a0to help set up Account Activity API webhooks.  \n**Is there a way to recover data if our system goes down for a period of time?**  \nWith the paid tiers of Account Activity API (Paid Premium and Enterprise), our system will [retry](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/activity-retries) to send the activities to you several times over a four hour period. If your system does not respond within that four hour period, then the activity will be lost and you will have to use other REST endpoints to recover data within 7 days.  \nWe suggest that you use your different webhooks, or environments, as a redundancy tool like the [Account Activity Replay API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/activity-replay-api) to ensure that you don't miss any activities if one of your systems goes down.  \n**What authentication do I have to use with the Account Activity API?**  \nThe authorization methods required for Account Activity API is described per method in the [API reference pages](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference). If you are just starting out with Twitter authentication, we recommend that you read through [this section](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth).  \n**What is a challenge-response check (CRC)?**  \nThe Account Activity API challenge response check is a security feature put in place to ensure that the Account Activity API\u2019s activities are being sent to the proper developer. It also can be used by developers to ensure that the data that they are receiving is coming from Twitter. Twitter will automatically send a CRC to your webhook URL once every 24 hours, starting the last time the webhook URL was validated. Your system must respond with a valid response within 3 seconds to remain validated.  \nPlease visit our page [Securing webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/securing-webhooks) for more details.  \n**Is there anything that would immediately invalidate my webhook URL?**  \nIf one of the following occurs, we will immediately mark your webhook as invalid:  \n* The server responds to a CRC with an incorrect token. In this case, our system will not [retry](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/activity-retries) to send you the activity.\n* The webhook URL has an incorrect certificate configured.\u00a0In this case, our system will not\u00a0[retry](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/activity-retries)\u00a0to send you the activity.\n* Your server returning a non-2XX, non-4XXX, non-5XXX response code.\n* You specify the use of gzip without actually sending it.\n* You do not specify the use of gzip, but actually send it in the response.  \n**Will I get duplicate activities if subscribed to users that are interacting with each other?**  \nYes.\u00a0 If your web app has active subscriptions for User A and User B, and User A mentions User B in a Tweet, there will be two POST activities sent to the registered webhook.\u00a0 Each activity will have an indicator of \"for\\_user\\_id\" to show which subscription the activity belongs to.  \n**When I make a subscription to my webhook, can I replace the `/all/` portion of the following endpoint with other account activity data objects to limit the activities the API delivers?**\u00a0`POST https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account_activity/all/:env_name/subscriptions.json`  \nNo, this is not possible. As it currently stands, we only have the `/all/` product available.  \n**Is there any way of using the Account Activity API without requesting Direct Messages permissions from users?**  \nAt this point, Direct Messages permissions are required because there is no way to 'filter out' the Direct Messages activities for this API.  \n**Is there a free version of the Account Activity API?**  \nYes, we offer the sandbox version as a free tier. Our sandbox option is limited to a single webhook with a limit of a maximum of 15 subscriptions. You can read more about the sandbox option in [our documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/account-activity-api/overview).  \n**Is it possible to use the Account Activity API to get Retweets of Tweets that mention subscribed users?**  \nUnfortunately, this is not part of the activities delivered with this API. For this, we suggest using the Streaming API instead.  \n**What are the possible activity types that are represented by a tweet\\_create\\_event?**  \nA tweet\\_create\\_event payload will be sent:  \nIf the subscription user does any of the following actions:  \n* Creates a Tweet\n* Retweets\n* Replies to a Tweet  \nIf another user:  \n* @mentions\\* the subscription user\n* Quotes a Tweet created by the subscription user  \n\\*Note: The Account Activity API only delivers events when the subscription user would receive a notification from Twitter and could see the event publicly.\u00a0 This means, If the mentioned account (@userA) follows the protected account (@userB) then UserA will get a notification UserB mentioned them. If UserA is not following UserB (and approved by UserB) UserA will not get a notification, and therefore a tweet\\_create\\_event would not be sent via AAA if @userA had a subscription.  \n**If a blocked user mentions my subscribed user, how can I identify this?**  \nYou will see a boolean field \\`user\\_has\\_blocked\\` on the top level of the json response, set to either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\". This field will only be exposed on Tweet mentions.  \nEnterprise  \n**How can I add my app to an allowlist or check if my app is already on the allowlist?**  \nTo manage the [Twitter apps](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps) that you have added to an allowlist for access via the Enterprise APIs, please reach out to your account manager with your app ID. You can find your app ID by navigating to the [\"Apps\"](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps)\u00a0page in the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/overview).  \n**If I have access to three webhooks, can I use three webhooks for each of the apps that I have registered for enterprise use?**  \nThe webhook limit is set on the account level, not the app level. If you have access to three webhooks and two apps registered for enterprise use, you can use two webhooks on one app and the third on the other app, but not three on each app.  \n**Can I specify which types of events will be redelivered using the Account Activity Replay API?**  \nThe types of events to replay cannot be specified. All events delivered during the date and time window specified will be replayed.  \n**Will there be any retries if my application fails to ingest an Account Activity Replay API event?**  \nNo, there will not be any retries. If an application fails to ingest an event sent by the Account Activity Replay API, another Replay job can be submitted for the same time period to attempt redelivery of any missed Replay events.  \n**What should I do when I receive a partial success completion event?**  \nWe suggest making note of the timestamps for the events that were received and requesting another Replay job for the events that were missed.  \n**How many Account Activity Replay API jobs can I have running at a time?**  \nOnly one Account Activity Replay API job per webhook may be running at a time.  \n**How can I differentiate Account Activity Replay API events from real-time production events as they are delivered to my webhook?**  \nSince the Account Activity Replay API will always deliver events from the past, events can be differentiated from real-time production events based on the event\u2019s timestamp.  \n**How soon can I start using the Account Activity Replay API to redeliver an activity my application dropped or missed?**  \nAn activity becomes available for redelivery about 10 minutes after it was created.\n",

This error can trigger if you have entered the incorrect URI in your request.  \n#### Code 214 -\u00a0Webhook URL does not meet the requirements.  \n* Please make sure that you are using https.\n* Your webhook URL could be malformed.\n* Learn more about how to set up your webhook URL under the [Develop webhook consumer app](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks#webhook-url) section on [Getting started with webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks) page.  \n#### Code 214 -\u00a0High latency on CRC GET request. Your webhook should respond in less than 3 seconds.  \n* This means that your server is slow. Make sure that you are responding to the CRC within 3 seconds.  \n#### Code 214 -\u00a0Non-200 response code during CRC GET request (i.e. 404, 500, etc).  \n* Your server is down. Make sure that your server is running properly.  \n#### Code 214 -\u00a0Too many resources already created.  \n* **Enterprise** - You have already used all of your webhooks. Use the\u00a0[GET webhooks](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise#get-account-activity-webhooks) endpoint with each of your registered apps to identify where your webhooks are distributed.  \n#### Code 261 - Application cannot perform write actions.  \n* The\u00a0app that you are using with the API does not have the proper [permission level](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-permission-model) set for its access token and access token secret. Please navigate to the 'Keys and tokens' tab on the [Twitter apps](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps) dashboard and check the permission levels assigned to your access token and access token secret. If it is set to anything other than 'Read, write and Direct Messages,' then you are going to have to adjust the settings under the 'Permission' tab and regenerate your access token and access token secret to apply the new settings.\n* Alternatively, you are trying to register a webhook using app-only authentication, which is not supported. Please authenticate with user context instead as noted in the API reference sections for registering a webhook for [Enterprise Account Activity API](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise#post-account-activity-webhooks).  \nEnterprise Account Activity API  \naaa-enterprise\n",
