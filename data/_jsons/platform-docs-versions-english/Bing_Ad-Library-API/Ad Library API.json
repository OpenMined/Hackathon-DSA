If you're not signed in to your Microsoft account, you'll be redirected to sign in to your account or to sign up for one.

For details about authenticating Microsoft account credentials with OAuth, see [Authentication with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/authentication-oauth-identity-platform).  \nYou can use the Bing Ads SDK for .NET, Java, or Python to authenticate Microsoft account credentials. For details about using the SDK to get the access token, see [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started-csharp) | [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started-java) | [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started-python).  \n_Note_: The Bing Ads SDK doesn't provide interfaces for Ad Library API. You should only use the SDK to get the access token if you're using the SDK for Microsoft Advertising campaigns, too. Otherwise, it may not be worth the overhead of installing the SDK.  \nIf you don't use the Bing Ads SDK for authentication, see Authenticating Microsoft Account Credentials in C# for an example that shows how to use OAuth to authenticate Microsoft account credentials.\n",
