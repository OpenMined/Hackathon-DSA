It\u2019s as if you were directly obtaining a CSV of your List or Saved Search, but in JSON or XML format. Please note that we don't have all filters available in the new Search surface in the API yet, but all the same posts are available.\n",

You must paginate through those posts to reach the end of the query,  \n* You can see up to 100 posts at a time (_count_ parameter goes up to 100). To see the next one hundred posts, paginate using the _offset_ parameter. For example: set _count_ = 100 to see posts 1-100. Then, set _count_ = 100 and _offset_ = 100 to see posts 101 - 200. Continue increasing the _offset_ parameter in successive calls to see all posts.  \n* Each pagination will count against your rate limit. Slice thinly by date or SQL timeframe to separate your results into ~10k batches so you don't miss any data. To get more than 10k posts at a time, use Historical Data in the Dashboard rather than the API.  \n**Making sure you get all posts for a given time period**  \n* **Make sure to sort by Date to capture all posts.** If you don\u2019t specify the _sortby_ parameter, the API will by default return posts sorted by Overperforming. This will exclude posts that are Underperforming.  \n**Default rate limits and settings:**  \n* **/posts/search is not enabled by default.**  \n* **Rate limit defaults:** 6 calls/min for all but /links, which is 2 calls/min.  \n* **By default, the API object names do not match the CSV headers. This cannot be changed.**  \n* **The API uses the UTC timezone. This cannot be changed.** The CrowdTangle User Interface allows the user to change the time zone of their dashboard, so always account for time zone differences when comparing results in the API and UI.  \n* **By default, the subscriberCount property will show page Followers** (as of January 26, 2021). You can select either Page Likes or Followers in your Dashboard settings. [Learn more here](https://help.crowdtangle.com/en/articles/4797890-faq-measuring-followers).  \n**Platform IDs**  \n* **Platform IDs are external IDs native to the selected platform (Facebook, Instagram).** You can use our API (/posts or /leaderboard, for example) to programmatically fetch platformIDs for each account in a List or Dashboard you're interested in. If the post is from Facebook, you can also find the Platform ID in the URL of the post. For example, this url [https://www.facebook.com/81221197163/posts/10158939904512164](https://www.facebook.com/81221197163/posts/10158939904512164) has a platformID of _81221197163\\_10158939904512164._\n",
