We prioritize safety, well-being and integrity so our community can feel free to create, connect with each other and have fun.  \nMore than 40,000 security professionals work with innovative technologies to maintain and enforce our [Community Rules](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/), [General Conditions](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/terms-of-service/en) and [Advertising Policies](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertising-policies-ad-creatives-landing-page-prohibited-content?lang=en), which apply to all content on our platform. This latest report provides an overview of these efforts and shows how we continue to maintain trust, authenticity and accountability.  \nAs part of our ongoing efforts to facilitate analysis of the TikTok platform, we are now providing additional data regarding data deletion by policy category for the 50 markets with the highest volumes of deleted content (see Download File below). These markets account for around 90% of all content deletions for this quarter.  \nDuring the period under review, we extended eligibility for our [Search API](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/) to academic researchers in Europe, to support research on topics related to consumer trends, misinformation, mental health and more. We also launched a new [Commercial Content API](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/commercial-content-api) and opened our [Commercial Content Library](https://library.tiktok.com/) in Europe to bring greater transparency to paid advertising and other commercial content on TikTok.\n",

We are committed to investing in robust mechanisms that prioritize user security, data protection and regulatory compliance. Transparency about these efforts to safeguard the platform is an essential element of the sustainability of this commitment. Our [TikTok Facts](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-truths-a-new-series-on-our-privacy-and-data-security-practices) series aims to clarify our privacy and data security practices. We recently [delved](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-facts-how-we-secure-personal-information-and-store-data) into our approach to data storage and how we secure our community's personal information, and we will continue to share resources with our community to reflect important information about security and privacy at TikTok.  \nThese include updates on key initiatives in different parts of the world. Although TikTok is a global platform, we take a local approach to regulatory compliance by collaborating with stakeholders to better understand local concerns and meet our legal obligations. We continue to make progress on [Project Clover](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-eu/setting-a-new-standard-in-european-data-security-with-project-clover), an initiative announced in early 2023 to create a purpose-built data protection environment for TikTok's European users. We have begun migrating European user data to our first data center in Dublin, Ireland, and other data centers in Ireland and Norway are under construction. We are also pleased to announce our collaboration with industry leaders to test our defenses and protect our platform. We recently announced a partnership with NCC Group, the third-party European security company that will independently audit the Clover project's data controls and protections, monitor data flows, provide independent verification and report any incidents.  \nIn keeping with our commitment to security, we celebrated the third anniversary of our global bug bounty program with HackerOne. This program encourages security researchers to proactively report security flaws so that we can fix them. In the third quarter of 2023, our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/tiktok?type=team) triaged and resolved 59 reports, representing over $112,000 in rewards.  \nAs always, we remain vigilant in our efforts to detect external threats and protect the platform from inauthentic or false accounts and engagements. These threats attack and challenge our systems on an ongoing basis, which can lead to occasional fluctuations in the indicators reported in these areas. Nevertheless, we remain committed to quickly identifying and removing any account, content or activity aimed at artificially increasing popularity on our platform. In this context of constantly evolving threats, TikTok is committed to preserving the integrity of its community and strengthening our response to the various actors.  \n#### **Spam and false engagement**  \n* * *\n",

We prioritize the safety and well-being of young people throughout our policy development process. This includes prohibiting child pornography, youth abuse, harassment, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overly mature themes, and the use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs or controlled substances. When we identify cases of exploitation of young people on our platform, we take immediate action, including banning the offending account and all associated accounts.  \nWe are also adding enforcement information for TikTok LIVE, which allows users and creators to interact in real time. In the second quarter of 2023, we suspended 8,074,632 LIVE sessions. This represents 1.5% of the total number of LIVE sessions over the same period.

First, we give you an overview of the language skills of TikTok's moderators, whose work not only contributes to making the platform safer, but also plays a vital role in improving our automated moderation systems. Secondly, we will provide you with data on the processing times for the removal of violent content reported by our community using our online and in-app reporting tools.  \nDuring the period covered by this report, we updated TikTok's [Community Rules](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/community-guidelines-update). These rules came into effect in April 2023 and will be reflected in our next report.  \n### Safety  \nWe remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the platform from threats, including the presence of inauthentic or false accounts and engagements. These threats attack and challenge our systems on an ongoing basis, which can lead to occasional fluctuations in the indicators reported in these areas. Nevertheless, we remain committed to quickly identifying and removing any account, content or activity aimed at artificially increasing popularity on our platform.  \nProtecting our community is our top priority. Although TikTok is a global platform, we take a local approach to regulatory compliance by collaborating with stakeholders to better understand local concerns and meet our legal obligations. In the U.S., we have created a dedicated division called [TikTok U.S. Data Security (USDS)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-approach-to-keeping-us-data-secure) to strengthen our data protection policies and protocols, further protect our users and build confidence in our U.S. systems and controls. In addition, we have launched [Project Clover](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-eu/setting-a-new-standard-in-european-data-security-with-project-clover), an initiative to create a secure environment specifically designed for TikTok's European user data. Through Project Clover, we are designing and implementing a series of new measures to strengthen existing protections, add new ones and align our overall approach to data governance with the principle of European data sovereignty.  \nIn this context of constantly evolving threats, TikTok is committed to preserving the integrity of its community and strengthening its defenses against external threats. We are committed to preserving the trust placed in us by our users, and will continue to invest in robust mechanisms that prioritize user security, data protection and regulatory compliance.\n",

We continue to innovate in our approach to protecting people, including deleting content, making certain content [ineligible for recommendation in \"For You\" feeds](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en#44), introducing [new content filtering tools](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/de-nouvelles-opportunites-de-divertir-la-communaute) and an [update to our moderation policy](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/soutenir-les-createurs-avec-une-mise-a-jour-de-notre-politique-de-moderation) to ensure that every user's \"For You\" feed is populated with content that is appropriate and entertaining for them.In addition, TikTok attaches particular importance to safety and compliance regulations. That's why we allocate significant resources to enforcing various legislation, such as the European Digital Services Act (DSA). Transparency is at the heart of the DSA and calls for accountability, which is fully in line with TikTok's ethics.  \nTo help us achieve this goal on a large scale, we are investing in [technologies](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety) that enable us to automatically detect and remove violent content, helping to reduce the volume of content reviewed by moderators, allowing more of them to focus on more complex and contextual areas, such as misinformation, hate speech and harassment. When it comes to monitoring compliance with legislation, our approach aims to:  \n* Minimize the posting of content that violates our Community Rules;\n* Prioritize the rapid removal of particularly offensive content, such as child pornography and violent extremism;\n* Ensure consistency and fairness in the application of legislation to reduce the number of unjustified deletions.  \nTo better realize this vision, last year we continued to invest in automatic machine learning and an architecture upgrade that takes into account video, text and audio content, as well as the potential severity of the offense and the potential reach of the video (for example, based on the number of people following it) to determine the best course of action. For example, content may be deleted automatically, made ineligible for recommendation in \"For You\" feeds, or directed to a moderator for further review. We have also introduced a new, more transparent control system for creators. We believe these improvements enable us to offer a better experience to creators while continuing to advance our commitment to safety across the platform. Overall, these efforts have improved the accuracy and effectiveness of our monitoring, as reflected in the data in this report.\n",

In addition, we regularly publish information on the measures we've taken to be accountable to our community.  \nTikTok uses innovative technologies and moderators to identify, investigate and act on content that violates our rules.

Our rules apply to everyone and to all content, and we strive to be consistent and fair in their application. This analysis provides contextual elements to help appreciate the data in this report.  \n#### **Safety**  \nThis report has been produced to bring greater transparency to our actions, our progress and our challenges, and to assume our responsibilities towards our community. To provide useful and relevant information, we now offer additional information on video takedowns for over 50 markets, representing around 90% of all content takedowns.  \nIn addition, this report now includes information on hidden influence operations that we have identified and removed from our platform over the period July to September. To investigate and remove these operations, we focus on behaviors, and evaluate the relationships between accounts and the techniques used, to determine whether the users involved are acting in a coordinated way to deceive TikTok's systems or our community. In each case, we are convinced that the individuals behind these activities are working together to misrepresent themselves and their actions. We know that covert influence operations will continue to develop in order to bypass our detection systems, and some networks may try to re-establish their presence on our platform. For example, in addition to the networks denounced in this report, 365 additional accounts have been identified as belonging to previously removed networks and have therefore been removed. In view of the increase in these new forms of deceptive behavior, we will continue to adapt our responses, strengthen our enforcement capacity and publish the results of our investigations.  \n#### **Safety**  \nWe continue to develop and adapt our protection measures, investing in automated systems to detect, block and remove artificial accounts and interactions, and improving our reaction time and response to evolving threats. Due to the conflicting nature of malicious users, we will be modifying rule enforcement data for fake accounts. This reinforces our commitment to removing any content or activity that seeks to artificially increase its popularity on the platform.  \n#### **Advertising content**  \nTikTok has strict policies in place to protect users from false, fraudulent or misleading content, including advertising content. Advertiser accounts and ad content are subject to these policies and must comply with our Community Rules, Advertising Rules and Terms of Use. Although the total volume of ad content removed for non-compliance with our advertising policies decreased in this quarter, the number of ad content removed due to account-level actions increased. This is due in part to our new approach to advertising policy non-compliance and the strengthening of our account-level enforcement capabilities. We are aware that, to guarantee the security of our advertisers and users, we must make constant efforts. We are therefore committed to regularly analyzing and strengthening our systems for combating advertising content that does not comply with our policies.\n",

To achieve this effectively on a large scale, we continue to invest in reporting and moderation technologies. Where our software can reliably detect illicit content, we use automated moderation devices to quickly remove content that violates our policies. Our detection and protection capabilities have improved accordingly.  \nThe use of machine learning technologies has been decisive in the fight against the circulation of false information. We have improved the adaptability of our systems to cope with the unpredictable and ever-changing nature of disinformation content, particularly during crises or exceptional events (for example, during the war in Ukraine or on the occasion of an election). We have also further developed our ability to detect proven misleading audiovisual content, in order to limit content manipulation on the platform. As a result of these investments, this quarter saw improvements in the application of our integrity and authenticity policies: proactive video deletion increased from 83.6% in the first quarter to 89.1% in the second; deletion of videos with no playback improved from 60.8% in the first quarter to 74.7% in the second; and video deletion in less than 24 hours rose from 71.9% to 83.9%.\n",

Our rules apply to everyone and all content, and we strive to be consistent and fair in their application.  \n#### Response to the war in Ukraine  \nAs a platform, our response to the war in Ukraine has been to strengthen protection and security measures to ensure that users can express themselves and share their experiences. Also, we are working hard to combat damaging false information and any other violations of our policies. War has forced us to face up to a complex and constantly changing world. We have therefore increased our investment in our fact-checking partners, who help to assess the accuracy of content. We have adapted our detection methods to take swifter action against accounts attempting to scam or mislead our community through Lives (live videos) and unoriginal video content. In addition, we launched a pilot of our state-controlled media policy, tagging the content of certain accounts to provide important context for our users. In response to Russia's \"fake news\" law and its security implications, we had no choice but to suspend live broadcasts and new content on our video service in Russia from March 6. The safety of our employees and creators is our top priority. For this reason, content broadcast by accounts established outside Russia is currently not accessible in Russia.  \nFrom February 24 to March 31, 2022, we have taken the following measures to protect our community:  \n* Our security team, mobilized on the war in Ukraine, removed 41,191 videos, 87% of which violated our anti-disinformation policies. The vast majority (78%) were proactively identified.\n* Our fact-checking partners contributed to the analysis of 13,738 videos worldwide.\n* We added warnings to 5,600 videos to alert users that content could not be validated by our verification partners.\n* We identified the content of 49 Russian state-controlled media accounts using tags.\n* We identified and removed 6 networks and 204 accounts worldwide for coordinated attempts to influence public opinion and mislead users about their identity.  \n#### Advertising content  \nTikTok has strict policies in place to protect users from false, fraudulent or misleading content, including advertising content. Advertiser accounts and ad content are subject to these policies and must comply with our Community Rules, Advertising Rules and Terms of Use. During the first quarter of 2022, the total volume of ads removed for non-compliance with our advertising policies and guidelines increased. This is due to the evolution of our approach to ad enforcement and the strengthening of our account control capabilities. Previously, any account found to be in breach of our policies resulted in the blocking of all advertising traffic associated with that account. Now, with our new approach, we are able to remove all advertising associated with these accounts from our internal systems. While the end result is the same for our users, we believe this measure improves the advertising ecosystem and demonstrates our commitment to creating a safe and positive environment for our users.\n",

Our rules apply to everyone and all content, and we strive to be consistent and fair in their application.  \n#### Security  \nWe combine technology and human intervention to identify and remove breaches of the Community Rules, and we continually invest in our policies, products and partnerships to enhance the safety of our entire community and platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we continued to enhance our machine learning moderation techniques, improving the relevance and accuracy of our automated removal systems.  \nThanks to ongoing improvements in audio and voice recognition and detection, we have significantly perfected the proactive detection and removal of content related to suicide, self-harm, dangerous acts, hateful behavior or constituting harassment and bullying. In addition, the ongoing optimization of our detection models relating to the safety of minors has improved the effectiveness of our moderation system. The number of videos reinstated after being appealed decreased compared to the previous quarter, which we attribute to a reduction in false positives and an improvement in the accuracy of our automatic detection and removal system.  \n#### Security  \nWe continue to develop and adapt our protective measures, investing in automated systems to detect, block and remove artificial accounts and interactions, and improving our reaction time and response to evolving threats. In Q4 2021, we developed additional monitoring systems and enhanced existing platforms and processes for handling technical support tickets. This has strengthened our ability to detect the creation of fraudulent user accounts during registration, and to remove fake followers, fake \"likes\" and videos associated with these accounts.  \n#### Advertising content  \nTikTok has strict policies in place to protect users from misleading, fraudulent or deceptive content, including advertising content. Advertiser accounts and ad content are subject to these policies and must comply with our Community Rules, Advertising Rules and Terms of Use. Despite an overall increase in ads published on TikTok during the fourth quarter of 2021, the total volume of ads removed for non-compliance with our advertising policies and guidelines decreased. This is due in part to the efforts of several teams dedicated to improving our advertising ecosystem and helping to create better experiences for users and advertisers on our platform. We are committed to creating a safe and positive environment for our users, and we regularly review and strengthen our systems to combat ads that break our rules.\n",

This is a very complex and nuanced area in which we must continue to improve.

This figure includes 11,205,597 accounts suspected of belonging to minors that were deleted for potentially belonging to someone under the age of 13, representing less than 1% of all accounts on TikTok.  \n#### False activity  \nWe continue to evolve and adapt our protection measures, investing in automated defenses to detect, block and remove inauthentic accounts and engagements, and improving our speed and responsiveness to ever-changing threats. From April to June, we prevented the creation of 148,759,987 fake accounts. We also removed 8,542,037 videos posted by spam accounts.  \nWe also identified and prevented 632,416,873 tracking attempts by fake accounts, and removed 71,935,583 accounts that were tracking other users. We also prevented 9,612,942,242 likes and corrected 91,812,066 inauthentic likes by these accounts.  \n#### Advertising content  \nTikTok has implemented [strict policies](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000962) to protect users from misleading, fraudulent or deceptive advertising content. Advertiser accounts and paid advertisements are subject to these rules and must comply with our Community Rules, our [Advertising Rules](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000962) as well as our Terms of Use. During the second quarter of 2021, we rejected 1,829,219 pieces of advertising content for violating our advertising policies and rules. We are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive, authentic and enjoyable experience when viewing ads on TikTok, in this regard we will continue to invest not only in our human resources but also in technological means to ensure advertising content that is in line with our expectations.  \n### Data report  \n#### Safety of young people  \nIn order to maintain a safe and positive environment for our community, and in particular for teenagers, we strive every day to learn, adapt and reinforce our policies and practices. We believe we are most effective when we collaborate with industry peers to advance these efforts. So, in May 2021, we joined the [\"Technology Coalition\"](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/tiktok-rejoint-la-technology-coalition), an organization that works to protect children from online sexual exploitation and abuse, to deepen our approach to evidence-based intervention. We also explained the multiple approaches we take to promote age-appropriate experiences and ensure that the TikTok experience continues to be accessible to 13-year-olds and above.  \nDuring the second quarter of 2021, we also updated our Security Center. We're aware of the challenges facing parents in the digital age, and as part of our efforts to support and educate families on our platform, we've introduced the [Parent Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/fr-fr/guardians-guide/), a one-stop space for everything you need to know about TikTok. Here you'll find all the information you need to get started on the platform, an overview of our security and privacy tools and features, such as [Family Connection Mode](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/de-nouvelles-ressources-sur-le-mode-connexion-famille-de-tiktok), and numerous resources to answer questions about online safety.  \n#### Wellness  \nAt TikTok, we focus on the well-being of our users, so that our community can continue to grow, flourish and surprise the world with its creativity. So we're always looking for new ways to contribute to the well-being of our community. In the second quarter of 2021, we:  \n* Added new settings so that, among other things, [multiple comments can be reported or deleted simultaneously](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/de-nouveaux-outils-pour-lutter-contre-le-harcelement), and accounts that post bullying or other negative comments can be blocked at the same time (up to 100 at a time).\n* Published a bullying prevention guide to help families learn how to identify bullying, as well as tools to deal with it and help victims or witnesses of bullying.\n* Launched [#CreateKindness](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/encourager-la-bienveillance-sur-tiktok), an international campaign and series of creative videos aimed at raising awareness of the dangers of online bullying and encouraging users to be kind and loving to one another.  \nWe aim to provide a safe space where users feel welcome and can express themselves as they are. We want the diversity of our community to feel free to share and express themselves. In the second quarter of 2021, we celebrated Pride Month with our #FreeToBe campaign. We highlighted LGBTQ+ designers and organized our global TikTok Pride Parade, a 12-hour LIVE event that raised funds for organizations that support the LGBTQ+ community.  \n#### Protecting the integrity of the platform  \nWe strive to build responsibly, openly and fairly so that TikTok users continue to love creating and viewing the content they care about. To support our teams who develop our security strategies and are responsible for enforcing our policies, we have partnered with the [Trust and Safety Professional Association (TSPA)](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/tiktok-rejoint-la-trust-and-safety-professional-association), so that every professional working on security issues is now a TSPA member. Membership gives them access to career development resources, workshops and events, and a network of industry peers. Our support of the association will also enrich the TikTok community by enabling us to continue to learn and evolve our approach to safety.\n",

Our teams work hard every day to enforce our [Community Rules](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), removing accounts and content that do not comply with them, to provide a safe and caring environment for our community. We take care to be transparent about how we apply our policies to strengthen the bonds of trust with our community members. We regularly publish these reports.  \nFrom now on, we'll be publishing quarterly - every three months instead of every six - to report on the application of our Community Rules. Due to the constraints involved in processing applications, information relating to requests submitted by public authorities and governments, as well as requests for withdrawal due to intellectual property infringement, will continue to be published on a half-yearly basis.  \nOur Community Rules apply to all users and all content on the platform. Our TikTok teams of safety, security and policy experts work together to design fair rules that can be consistently enforced. Our policies take into account feedback from external experts in digital security and human rights, and we take care to respect the cultures of the countries where we operate. Under no circumstances do we develop policies at the express request of a government, individual or organization, and no TikTok employee is authorized to unilaterally modify the Community Rules. Our main objective is that our rules make TikTok a caring space that encourages creativity and authenticity.  \nThis report provides visibility into the volume and nature of content and accounts removed from the platform during the first three months of 2021 (January 1 to March 31). For the first time, we publish the number of accounts suspected of being held by users under the age of 13, as we strive to make TikTok an over-13-only space.\n",

        "content": "Source document: data/platform-docs-versions-english/TikTok_Transparency/Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports.md\nParagraph location: \n\t**Advertising content**\n\tData report\n\nContent: \n### Data report  \n#### Videos  \nIn the first quarter of 2021, **61,951,327** videos were removed worldwide for violating our Community Rules or Terms of Use, less than **1%** of all videos uploaded to TikTok. Of these videos, we identified and removed **91.3%** before a user reported them, **81.8%** before they were viewed and **93.1%** within 24 hours of publication.  \nThis graph shows the five markets with the highest number of deleted videos.  \n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| ****Country / Market**** | **Total deletions** |\n| United States 8,540,088 |\n| Pakistan 6,495,992 |\n| Brazil 6,128,568 |\n| Russia 3,747,364 |\n| Indonesia 2,757,292 |  \nWe continue to rely on technology to automatically detect and remove infringing content in certain markets. **An additional 8,832,345** videos were reported and automatically removed for violating our Community Rules worldwide.  \nTikTok allows creators to contest the removal of their video. When we receive a request for review, we examine the video a second time and reinstate it if it turns out to have been removed in error. In the last quarter, we restored **2,833,837** videos that had been subject to a review request. Our aim is to be consistent and fair in our moderation practices, and we are continuing our efforts to reduce the number of \"false positives\" and continuously train our moderation teams.  \nThe graph below illustrates the number of videos removed for breaches of our policy. A video may infringe several rules, and each infringement is reflected in this chart.  \nAmong the videos removed by our moderation team, the following table shows the rate of proactive removal of videos for reasons infringing our Community Rules. Proactive removal means detecting and removing a video before it is reported. Removal within 24 hours means that the video is removed within 24 hours of publication on our platform.  \n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Proactive removal** | **Removal within 24 hours** |\n| Nudity and sexual activity of adult users | 86.10% | 89.80% |\n| Harassment and Bullying | 66.20% | 83.80% |\n| Hate Behavior | 67.30% | 83.90% |\n| Illegal Activities and Regulated Products | 96.00% | 95.60% |\n| Integrity and Authenticity | 78.50% | 88.90% |\n| Safety of Minors | 97.10% | 96.20% |\n| Suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts | 93.70% | 91.70% |\n| Violent and visually explicit content | 93.40% | 93.60% |\n| Violent extremism | 82.10% | 87.10% |  \n[Nudity and sexual activity of adult users](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#30)We strive to build a safe and welcoming platform. As such, we remove all nudity and sexually explicit content. Of the videos removed, 15.6% violated these rules, down from 20.5% in our previous report. TikTok removes all pornographic and nudity content, without exception. For content that would be more appropriate for mature audiences, we may limit its distribution in any user's \"For You\" feed, rather than deleting it. We removed 86.1% of these videos before they were reported to us, while 89.8% were removed within 24 hours of publication, a slight decrease since our last report.  \n[Harassment and bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#36)\nWe advocate an inclusive community where people can express themselves freely, and we do not tolerate members of our community being humiliated, intimidated or harassed. Of the videos we removed, 8% violated this rule, marking an increase from 6.6% over the second half of 2020. This increase reflects updates to our rules at the end of the year, with the aim of combating bullying, as well as slight improvements in our ability to detect harassment or bullying. Of these videos, 66.2% were removed before they were reported to us, and 83.8% were removed within 24 hours of publication. To prevent bullying behavior, and as part of our efforts to improve proactive detection in this area, we have deployed several tools to help creators better control their TikTok experience, including comment management, reporting and user blocking.  \n[Hateful behavior](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#38)\nTikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that does not tolerate hateful behavior. Of the videos we removed, 2.3% violated this rule, representing a slight increase from 2% in the second half of 2020. We attribute this increase in removals to enhanced protection measures against hate speech and hate ideologies, as well as to our new model which enables us to better spot hate speech. We removed 67.3% of videos depicting hateful behavior before they were reported to us, although 83.9% were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \n[Illegal activities and regulated products](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#32)\nWe take great care to ensure that TikTok does not enable criminal activities or activities promoting drugs, tobacco, alcohol or any other regulated product. In the first three months of 2021, 21.1% of the videos we removed violated this rule. This figure is up from 17.9% in the second half of 2020, and we have seen an increase in attempts to publish this type of content on the platform. Of these videos, 96% were removed before being reported to us, and 95.6% were removed within 24 hours of publication. We attribute these improvements to the ongoing refinement of our detection systems.  \n[Integrity and authenticity](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#37)\nWe believe that trust is the foundation of our community, and we do not allow any content or accounts that involve artificial interaction, impersonation and misinformation activity. Of the videos removed, 2% were in breach of this rule, down from 2.4% in the second half of 2020. Of these videos, 78.5% were removed before being reported to us, and 88.9% were removed within 24 hours of publication. We have continued to improve our models for detecting misleading information, and these efforts have contributed to a significant increase in proactive flagging in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the last six months of 2020.  \n[Safety of minors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#31)\nWe are firmly committed to ensuring the safety of minors, and regularly update our policy and procedures to protect them. In the first quarter of 2021, 36.8% of content violated our policy on the safety of minors, compared with 36% in the second half of 2020. Of these videos, 97.1% were removed before being reported to us, and 96.2% were removed within 24 hours of publication. This progress in proactive detection is the result of our improved models, which identify and report infringements as soon as content is uploaded, before it is viewed.  \n[Suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#34)\nThe health and well-being of the individuals who make up our community are of the utmost importance to us. In this respect, we are committed to fostering a supportive environment. Of the videos removed, 5.7% were in breach of this rule, down from 6.2% in the second 2020. We believe these results are linked to a reduction in the overall volume of these videos, as we make a concerted effort to remove content quickly and redirect those seeking it to specialist support services and emergency resources. Of these videos, 93.7% were removed before being reported to us, and 91.7% were removed within 24 hours of publication  \n[Violent extremism](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#39)\nWe strongly oppose all forms of violence on and off TikTok. Of the videos deleted, 0.5% violated this rule, compared with 0.3% in the second half of 2020. Of these videos, 82.1% were deleted before being reported to us, and 87.1% were deleted within 24 hours of publication. We believe this increase in deletions is due to the fact that our rules now specify in greater detail what is considered a violent threat and/or incitement to violence in terms of prohibited content and behavior. We are developing proactive detection models to flag up this type of content, and are also examining reports submitted by users and non-governmental organizations.  \n[Violent and visually explicit content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#35)\nTikTok is a platform that encourages creative expression but condemns offensive or violent content. Of the videos removed, 8.1% were in breach of this rule, in line with figures for the second half of 2020. Of these videos, 93.4% were removed before being reported to us, and 93.6% were removed within 24 hours of publication. This is an improvement on our last report, linked to the strengthening of our policies and better detection of this type of content.  \n#### Accounts  \nIn the first quarter of 2021, **11,149,514** accounts were deleted for infringement of our Community Rules or Terms of Use. This figure includes **7,263,952** accounts removed because they were suspected of being held by users under the age of 13, or less than 1% of accounts on TikTok.  \nIn addition, we prevented the creation of **71,470,161** accounts by automated methods and removed **12,378,928** additional videos posted by spammers.  \n#### Advertising content  \nTikTok has implemented [strict measures](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000962) to protect users from misleading, fraudulent or deceptive advertising content. Advertiser accounts and paid advertisements are subject to these rules and must comply with our Community Rules, [TikTok Advertising Policies](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000962) and Terms of Use. In the first quarter of 2021, we rejected **1,921,900** of advertising content for violating our advertising policies and rules.  \nWe are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive, authentic and enjoyable experience when viewing ads on TikTok. As such, we will continue to invest in both our human resources and our technological resources to ensure that the platform's advertising content meets our expectations.  \n#### Security  \nIn October 2020, we launched [the global \"bug bounty\" program](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-au/security-is-our-priority-all-year-long-au) which is an extension of our vulnerability management program. Its aim is to proactively identify and resolve security vulnerabilities. This program reinforces our security maturity by encouraging security researchers around the world to responsibly identify and report bugs to our teams so that we can resolve them before criminals exploit them.  \nIn the first quarter of 2021, TikTok received **33** valid bug reports, of which **29** were resolved. We received **8** public disclosure requests, all of which have been published. On average, TikTok settles rewards within **3 days**. As for TikTok's response time, on average, the first response time is **8 hours** and the resolution time is **30 days**.\n",

As of January 2021, all default privacy settings for our users aged 13 to 15 are automatically set to Private Mode, limiting who is allowed to upload their videos and interact with their content via comments, or the Duets and Collage functions. For users aged 16 and 17, the Duo and Collage functions are set to Friends. By default, the option for choosing who is authorized to download is set to Off.  \nThis is an important initiative to reinforce the security and privacy of minors. These updates build on previous age-restriction features, including the removal of Direct Messaging, livestreaming and virtual gifts for all users under the age of 16 or 18 respectively. Our ambition is to help users make informed choices about what they want to share and with whom. By involving teenagers from the outset, we hope to empower them to carefully manage their online presence. We also want to support parents by providing them with [tools and resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/guardians-guide/) that will enable them to dialogue with teens about their online safety and digital literacy. For example, the [Family Connection Mode](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/connexion-famille-mise-a-jour) enables parents to link their TikTok account to that of their teenager, and together they can define certain parameters for confidentiality, browsing and screen time.  \n#### Wellness  \nOur diverse community makes TikTok a great place to explore and enjoy entertaining content, from cooking recipes to gardening ideas. We strive to make TikTok a safe and positive environment, and with this in mind, we've developed new tools to promote caring and respect within our community.  \n* We've developed [a notification](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/filtres-tous-commentaires) that invites users to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a comment that might be unpleasant.\n* We introduced a way for creators to filter all comments on their content so that only approved comments appear on their videos.\n* We announced a partnership with the Cyberbullying Research Center to advance our knowledge of bullying and develop new anti-bullying initiatives.  \nWe want everyone to feel comfortable and confident expressing themselves fully on TikTok. To encourage [body diversity on TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/supporting-nedawareness-and-body-inclusivity-on-tiktok), since February we've been offering wellness resources, developed with the help of eating disorder experts, to help users identify negative self-talk, become aware of their own assets and strengths, or support a friend who may be going through a difficult time. We also published ongoing PSAs on relevant hashtags to raise awareness or encourage community support for people with eating disorders and their recovery.  \n#### Protecting the integrity of the platform  \nWe maintain our efforts to combat content and behavior that is intended to jeopardize the integrity of our platform. To achieve this goal with regard to illegal activities and regulated products, we have joined the [Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-joins-the-coalition-to-end-wildlife-trafficking-online), which enables us to collaborate with other industry players on best practices as well as emerging content and trends.  \nIn addition, TikTok removes or limits misleading information as soon as it is identified. We work with 11 organizations accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network to verify facts in 21 languages and 57 markets in America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. If investigations confirm that content is false, it is removed from the platform. This year, in the first three months, we [introduced a feature](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) aimed at reducing the spread of unsubstantiated content.\n",

Of these videos, we identified and removed **92.4%** before they were reported by a user, **83.3%** were removed before they were viewed and **93.5%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \nThis graph illustrates the five markets with the highest number of removed videos.  \n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Countries** | **Total removals** |\n| United States 11,775,777 |\n| Pakistan 8,215,633 |\n| Brazil 7,506,599 |\n| Russia 4,574,690 |\n| Indonesia 3,860,156 |  \nDue to the pandemic, we continue to rely on technology to automatically detect and remove infringing content in certain markets, such as Brazil and Pakistan. **8,295,164** additional videos were reported and automatically removed for infringing our Community Rules. These videos are not included in the tables below.  \nTikTok allows creators to contest the removal of their video. When we receive a request for review, we examine the video a second time and reinstate it if it does not infringe our rules. Over the past six months, we have restored **2,927,391** videos that have been subject to a request for review.  \nThis graph illustrates the number of videos removed for infringement of our policy. A video may infringe several rules, and each infringement is reflected in this chart.  \nAmong the videos removed by our team of moderators, the following table shows the rate of proactive removal of videos for reasons infringing our Community Rules. Proactive removal means detecting and removing a video before it is reported. Removal within 24 hours means that the video is removed within 24 hours of publication on our platform.  \n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Proactive removal rate** | **Deletion rate** |\n| [Nudity and sexual activity of adult users](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#30) | 88.30% | 90.60% |\n| [Harassment and bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#36) | 66.50% | 84.10% |\n| [Hate Behavior](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#38) | 72.90% | 83.50% |\n| [Illegal Activities and Regulated Products](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#32) | 96.30% | 94.80% |\n| [Integrity and Authenticity](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#37) | 70.50% | 91.30% |\n| [Safety of Minors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#31) | 97.10% | 95.80% |\n| [Suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#34) | 94.40% | 91.90% |\n| [Violent and visually explicit content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#35) | 93.20% | 92.70% |\n| [Violent extremism](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#39) | 86.90% | 89.40% |  \n**Nudity and sexual activities of adult users](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#30)**\nWe strive to create a safe and caring platform, and remove all nudity and sexually explicit content. Of the videos removed, **20.5%** violated these rules, which corresponds to a decrease of **30.9%** compared to the first half of 2020. One of the reasons for this decrease is the improvement of our sorting systems, which separate nudity content for adult users from that for underage users. We removed **88.3%** of these videos before they were reported to us, and **90.6%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \n**Harassment and bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#36)**\nWe advocate an inclusive community where people can express themselves freely without fear of abuse. We do not tolerate members of our community being humiliated, intimidated or harassed. Of the videos we removed, **6.6%** violated these rules, compared with **2.5%** in the first half of 2020. This increase reflects adjustments to the rules on sexual harassment, hacking threats and victims of bullying statements, which are now more comprehensive. In addition, we have seen slight improvements in our ability to proactively detect harassment or bullying, which remains a challenge given linguistic and cultural nuances. Of these videos, **66.5%** were removed before they were reported to us, and **84.1%** were removed within 24 hours of publication. We are committed to reducing this gap, and will keep our community informed of developments in this area.  \n**Hateful behavior](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#38)**\nTikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that does not tolerate hateful behavior. Last year, we changed our policy from \"hate speech\" to its current name of \"hateful behavior\" to take a broader approach to combating hateful ideologies and off-platform activity. As a result, **2%** of the videos we removed violated this rule, compared with **0.8%** in the first half of 2020. We have systems in place to detect hate symbols, such as flags and icons, but proactively detecting hate speech remains a challenge and we continue to invest to improve. We removed **72.9%** of videos depicting hateful behavior before they were reported to us, although **83.5%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \n**Illegal activities and regulated products](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#32)**\nWe take great care to ensure that TikTok does not enable activities that violate applicable laws or regulations, such as fraud or scams. **17.9%** of the videos we removed infringed this rule. This is down slightly from **19.6%** in the first half of 2020. We attribute this result to improvements in our automation and detection systems, as well as to more efficient workflows. Of these videos, **96.3%** were removed before being reported, and **94.8%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \n**Integrity and authenticity](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#37)**\nWe believe that trust is the foundation of our community, and we do not allow any content or accounts that involve artificial interaction, impersonation and misinformation activity. Of the videos removed, **2.4%** violated this rule, compared with **1.2%** in the first half of 2020. We have integrated new fact-checking partners in new markets and now have a network in 16 languages. This helps us to assess content more accurately and remove misleading information. We have also improved our ability to detect and remove artificial interactions and spam. Of the videos removed, **70.5%** were removed before they were reported to us, and **91.3%** were removed within 24 hours of publication. We are investing in our infrastructure to improve our proactive detection system, particularly when it comes to identifying misleading information.  \n**[Safety of minors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#31)**\nWe are firmly committed to ensuring the safety of minors, and regularly update our policy and procedures to protect them. For example, we have added a section dedicated to dangerous activities, and we remove any content depicting or promoting the consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs, or any other behavior that could jeopardize the well-being of minors. As a result, **36%** of the content we removed violated this rule, compared with **22.3%** in the first half of 2020. Of these videos, **97.1%** were removed before being reported to us, and **95.8%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \nTikTok relies on [PhotoDNA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna), a technology that helps identify and remove content that exploits children, to protect itself from child sexual abuse material. We continue to invest in our internal systems for detecting this type of content. These efforts have significantly improved our ability to remove and report relevant content and accounts to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the relevant legal authorities. As a result, we made **22,692 reports** to NCMEC in 2020, compared with **596** in 2019.  \n**Suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#34)**\nThe health and well-being of the individuals who make up our community are particularly important to us. In the second half of 2020, we updated our Community Rules on self-harm, suicide and eating disorders to reflect the comments and language used by mental health experts. We have also established partnerships with certain associations to support people in difficulty. For example, we redirect relevant searches and hashtags to the \"National Eating Disorder Association\" helpline, the \"Crisis Textline\" or the \"National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\". Of the videos removed, **6.2%** were in breach of these rules, down from **13.4%** in the first half of 2020, not least because we now remove all content featuring minors engaged in dangerous or risky behavior, under the terms of our new policy for the safety of minors in risky activities. Of these videos, **94.4%** were removed before being reported, and **91.9%** were removed within 24 hours of publication.  \n**Violent extremism](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#39)**\nWe strongly oppose all forms of violence on and off TikTok. Last fall, when we updated our Community Rules, we clarified our policy against violent people and organizations, to comprehensively address the challenges of violent extremism, and clarified what TikTok considers a threat or incitement to violence. Of all the videos removed, **0.3%** violated this rule, which is comparable to the content removed in the first half of 2020. Of these videos, **86.9%** were deleted before being reported, and **89.4%** were deleted within 24 hours of publication.  \n**Violent and visually explicit content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr#35)**\nTikTok is a platform that encourages creative expression but condemns shocking or violent content. Of the videos deleted, **8.1%** violated this rule, compared to **8.7%** in the first half of 2020. Of these videos, **93.2%** were removed before being reported, and **92.7%** were removed within 24 hours of publication. We allow videos depicting violent demonstrations, scenes of animals hunting in the wild and other such content on our platform for documentary purposes. We have also introduced [personalized viewing systems](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/refreshing-our-policies-to-support-community-well-being) to enable users to better choose the videos they watch.  \n#### Accounts  \nIn the second half of 2020, **6,144,040** accounts were deleted for violations of our Community Rules. In addition, **9,499,881** spam accounts were deleted, along with **5,225,800** spam videos posted by these accounts. We prevented **173,246,894** accounts from being created by spammers.  \n#### Advertising content  \nTikTok has implemented strict measures to protect users from misleading, fraudulent or deceptive content, including advertisements. Advertiser accounts and advertising content are subject to these rules and must comply with our Community Rules, Advertising Rules and Terms of Service. In the second half of 2020, we removed **3,501,477** of advertising content for violations of our advertising policies and rules. We are committed to creating a safe and caring environment for our users, and we regularly re-evaluate and improve our systems for combating advertising content that violates our policies.\n",

Here are some of the key updates we made in the second half of 2020.  \n#### Ensuring community well-being  \nWe have strengthened our [Rules C](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en)[ommunity](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=fr) to promote community well-being, taking into account behavior observed on the platform and feedback from our users and experts. For example, our updated policies on self-harm, suicide and eating disorders reflect recommendations from mental health experts. Our [advertising policies](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/coming-together-to-support-body-positivity-on-tiktok) now prohibit ads for fasting and weight-loss supplements. We have also improved the way we [inform our users](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/adding-clarity-to-content-removals) to help them understand why their video has been removed.  \nTikTok has partnered with various organizations to help people who may be struggling with an eating disorder, self-harming behavior or suicidal thoughts. From now on, searches for content and hashtags related to these themes will be redirected to helplines such as \"Suicide Ecoute\" or \"S.O.S Amiti\u00e9\", giving users access to free, confidential help. We offer advice on how to improve a person's emotional well-being.  \n#### Supporting families  \nWe hold regular discussions with parents, teenagers and youth safety experts to provide families with effective tools for a tailored TikTok experience. At the end of 2020, we expanded the functionality of our [Family Connection Mode](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/fr-fr/connexion-famille-mise-a-jour) to enable parents to strengthen protections on their teens' content and privacy settings. With features to limit searches, comments and screen time, we hope these tools will encourage families to dialogue more openly about digital safety.\n",

Our top priority is to help provide them with a safe environment, a positive experience and a sense of belonging to an ever-growing international community. We can't do this without transparency.  \nTikTok strives to be the most transparent and responsible company in its sector when it comes to issues such as protecting our users. We've put our money where our mouth is by opening our [Centers for Transparency and Accountability](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency), where we lift the veil on our content moderation, algorithms, privacy and security practices. We publish Transparency Reports such as this one to provide information on the amount and nature of content removed for breaching our Community Rules or Terms of Service. We also report on actions taken in the first quarter of 2020 to strengthen the security of our platform and promote a positive environment.\n",

When a video infringes our Community Rules, it is categorized according to the rule(s) infringed, and then removed. This means that the same video can be counted in more than one rule category.  \nAs a result of the coronavirus pandemic, we made greater use of technology to automatically detect and remove content in breach of our rules in markets such as India, Brazil and Pakistan. Of all the videos removed from the platform, 10,698,297 were flagged and automatically removed for infringing our Community Rules.

These Rules include new guidelines on [misleading content](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/building-to-support-integrity) aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation or potentially confusing content, as well as more nuanced guidelines in areas such as hate speech and encouraging inclusion. We are also publicly committed to promoting and supporting the [Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-supports-and-promotes-the-voluntary-principles-to-counter-online-child-exploitation) and the [Code of Practice against Misinformation](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/supporting-our-community-through-covid-19?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=d0c22ce942-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_17_05_00&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-d0c22ce942-190627564) adopted by the European Union.  \n#### Product  \n##### Showcasing our policies  \nTo support our policies, we have introduced a new feature that allows users to easily report different types of false information, which our team then investigates. Available in 8 countries, this _fact-checking_ program makes it easier to verify misleading and fraudulent content, such as untruths circulating about the new coronavirus, elections or global warming. We have also introduced educational messages of general interest, which appear in the application when hashtags associated with subjects that occupy an important place in public debate are used, such as elections, the Black Lives Matter movement, and dangerous conspiracy theories, like Qanon.  \n##### Promoting reliable, educational content to users  \nWe have continued to raise user awareness of our policies and security features by broadcasting, within the application, a series of [videos on the theme](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/youre-in-control-video-series-stars-tiktok-creators-to-educate-users-about-safety-features). To raise awareness of digital literacy among teenagers and their parents, we put the [TikTok portal for young people](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal?lang=fr) online, presenting the right reflexes to have for a safe online experience, as well as the control tools integrated into the application. We also created videos in TikTok format in which recognized creators raise our community's awareness of [media](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-be-informed-series-stars-tiktok-creators-to-educate-users-about-media-literacy) and [misinformation](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-in/tiktoks-matkarforward-initiative-urges-netizens-to-curb-the-spread-of-misinformation).  \nWe've focused our work on creating experiences that direct our users to trusted and recognized content in a wide range of areas. During the outbreak of the new coronavirus, we highlighted [authoritative content](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/covid-19) through information pages visible directly on the application. At the same time, we organized educational _Lives_ and hashtags challenges in partnership with the World Health Organization, the International Federation of the Red Cross, UNICEF India, and figures well known to those interested in public health and science, such as Bill Nye the Science Guy and [Prince's Trust](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/welcoming-the-princes-trust-to-tiktok). To support the [black community](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/progress-report-how-were-supporting-black-communities-and-promoting-diversity-and-inclusion), we've deployed [dedicated pages](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/recognizing-juneteenth) on our platform where users can learn about African-American history and organizations that have fought for social justice, while spotlighting black creators and artists throughout Black Music Month.  \n##### Reinforcing youth safety  \nTikTok has launched a series of cutting-edge features aimed at protecting young people and enabling parents and their teens to tailor their experience on TikTok to their needs. With [Family Connection](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing), parents can link their TikTok account to that of their teens to limit the visibility of certain content, encourage teens to moderate their viewing time, and modify direct messaging settings. TikTok disables this feature by default for accounts of users under 16, and does not allow private images to be sent in order to prevent the sharing of harmful or abusive content.  \n#### Partnerships  \nWe pay particular attention to the observations and recommendations of specialists, including non-profit organizations, as they reinforce the effectiveness of our rules, products and security systems and help us to make them more accessible to our community. In the first half of 2020, TikTok forged several important partnerships with leading international organizations in the field of security. Among the most notable are those established with the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal/get-access-to-more-info?lang=en&region=US) and with the [WePROTECT Global Alliance](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-joins-weprotect-global-alliance), through which we are committed to the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and the distribution of child pornography. In India, we work with the [Data Security Council of India](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-in/dsci-and-tiktok-launch) to raise public awareness of how to stay safe online. In the USA, we have set up our [Content Advisory Council](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency), which brings together specialists in issues such as hate speech, inclusive artificial intelligence and youth safety. We have also set up a [Creator Diversity Collective](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/progress-report-how-were-supporting-black-communities-and-promoting-diversity-and-inclusion) which brings together people from different backgrounds to ensure diversity, inclusion and their presence within our initiatives and platform.\n",

In this report, we highlight the reasons that led to videos being removed during December with regard to this new moderation infrastructure.

When a video goes against our Community Rules, it is identified according to the rule or different rules it violates and then removed. In this way, the same video can appear under multiple categories. For the month of December 2019, when we implemented our new content moderation system, the breakdown of rules broken is based on these new categories.  \nDuring the month of December, 25.5% of videos removed were under the category 'Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity'. To safeguard children's safety, 24.8% of videos were removed because they breached our rules on the protection of minors. This covers content such as risky, dangerous or illegal behavior for minors, such as the consumption of alcohol or drugs, or even more serious content for which we have decided to immediately remove and close the offending accounts. The latter have been reported to NCMEC and the relevant authorities where necessary. Content related to illegal activities and regulated goods accounted for 21.5% of deletions. In addition, 15.6% of videos removed were for violating our rules on suicide, self-harm or dangerous behavior, which mainly reflects the removal of risky challenges. Finally, 8.6% of videos removed were for breaching our rules relating to violent and visually explicit content; 3% for harassment or bullying; and less than 1% for breaching our rules relating to hate speech, integrity and authenticity or dangerous people or organizations.  \nSince then, the majority of our content has been processed by our new moderation system. Our subsequent reports will include more detailed data, both for content and accounts, and will cover the entire period in question.\n",

What's more, if they notice a breach of our Community Rules, we invite them to report it to our teams, directly from the application.  \n#### Account privacy  \nTikTok offers a wide range of privacy settings that users can activate when creating their account or at any other time. Currently, for private accounts, only authorized subscribers can view or comment on the videos of the user concerned, or send them a direct message.

They can also activate comment filters by creating a personalized list of keywords that will be automatically blocked. They can also disable comments on a specific video, limit comments to a selected audience or disable comments on their videos entirely.  \nWhat's more, we regularly educate our users about the security and digital wellbeing options available to them via video formats broadcast on the app and the [Security Center](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources). For example, with the help of designers, we have produced a series of videos encouraging users to control their screen time. Our screen time management function allows users to set a maximum threshold for application use.

Each of these videos demands a heightened level of responsibility on our part to protect the safety and well-being of our users. To enforce our Community Rules, we use a range of technologies and content moderation systems to identify and remove content and accounts that violate them.  \n#### Technology  \nTechnology is a key element in the implementation of our policies; our systems have been developed to automatically flag up content that might infringe our Community Rules. These systems take into account pattern or behavior identification models in order to flag up content likely to infringe our Community Rules. This enables us to take swift action and limit potential damage. For example, the vast majority of content such as spam and scams is automatically deleted. We regularly study trends, academic research and industry best practice to constantly improve our systems.\n",
