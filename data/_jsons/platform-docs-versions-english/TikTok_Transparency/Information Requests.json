All requests for information are carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Our [policies and procedures](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/law-enforcement?lang=en) define how TikTok will handle and respond to law enforcement requests and require TikTok to disclose or preserve user data only when a request is motivated by a valid legal proceeding or in an emergency. In exceptional emergency situations, TikTok will disclose users' personal data without legal process. This may occur when, in good faith, we have reason to believe that sharing information is necessary in the face of imminent risk of death or serious physical harm. To learn more about our policies and practices, please see our [Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines](https://support.tiktok.com/fr/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/law-enforcement-data-request-guidelines).
