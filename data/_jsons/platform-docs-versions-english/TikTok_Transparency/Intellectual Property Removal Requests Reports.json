We believe this is partly due to high-profile sporting events (e.g. the FIFA World Cup), our efforts to improve engagement with rights holders around sharing best practice for submitting valid requests, and our work to improve the efficiency of our email verification processes. For example, we now ask users to verify their e-mail address before they can submit a report, which has reduced the volume of spam and invalid reports we receive. In addition, we have seen a decrease in the number of honored requests for deletions related to copyright and trademark laws compared to the previous period. We believe this can be attributed in part to our efforts to deploy new tools that improve our ability to detect false owners and multiple requests to remove the same content.\n",
