Active monthly recipients in the EU\n\nContent: \n# Digital Services Regulations  \n### I. Active monthly recipients in the EU  \nIn accordance with Booking.com's obligations under EU digital services legislation, we estimate that the average monthly number of recipients* of the Booking.com service in the European Union, from February 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023 inclusive, is well over 45 million.  \nThis is only an estimate based on the data currently available to Booking.com and the limited guidelines of the Digital Services Act (\"DSA\"). This estimate is required to be published under the DSA and must not be used for any other purpose. The methodologies used to estimate the average monthly number of recipients as defined in the DSA require significant judgment and design input, are subject to data and other limitations, and are inherently subject to statistical variance and uncertainty. This estimate may be revised upwards or downwards as Booking.com refines its approach and in response to the publication of the methodology by the European Commission.  \nPlease refer to the [Booking Holdings Inc. Investor Relations](https://ir.bookingholdings.com/overview/default.aspx) website for measures we consider relevant to Booking.com's business.  \n\\*\"Service recipient\" is defined in the DSA as \"any natural or legal person who uses an intermediary service, in particular for the purposes of seeking information and making it accessible\". This requires counting the users to whom the information has been displayed by the Booking.com service, even if that user has not carried out a transaction.\n",
