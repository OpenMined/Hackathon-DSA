### Filtering Messages

The `messages` connection can be filtered to avoid pulling text that is part of thread warnings by the Messenger Apps. This is done via the `source` filter there only participants might be selected.


If this filter is not apply *admin text* (gray text appears in the thread by Messenger) will be retrieved as well.


#### Example

This call will retrieve the last 3 messages made only by the participants.



```

curl -i -X GET \
 "https://graph.facebook.com/v4.0/t_10155839492600149?fields=id,messages.source(PARTICIPANTS).limit(3)&access_token=<Access Token>"
