[Meta Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/adlibrary) is a
comprehensive, searchable database for ads transparency. People can use
the Ad Library to get more information about the ads they see across
Meta technologies.

People can search for all active ads running across products from Meta.
For ads about social issues, elections or politics, Meta provides
additional information, including spend, reach and funding entities.
These ads are visible whether they're active or inactive and are stored
in the Ad Library for 7 years.

Meta offers more information for ads that deliver an impression in the
EU or associated territories. These ads are displayed in the Ad Library
while active and archived for one year upon the delivery of their last
impression. The Ad Library also has a searchable database that displays
all active, public branded content running on Facebook and Instagram
with a paid partnership label.
