**Important notice:** On **[June 19, 2019]{.underline}** , we began
limiting total GET requests to the v1.1 /statuses/mentions_timeline and
/statuses/user_timeline endpoints to 100,000 requests per day. This is a
total request limit (per endpoint) applied across both user-auth and
app-auth requests. This means that in a 24-hour period, a single app can
make up to 100,000 requests to /statuses/mentions_timeline and/or
100,000 requests to /statuses/user_timeline (with either app or user
auth) before hitting this new app-level rate limit. The existing default
user-auth and app-auth rate limits remain the same.

A timeline is simply a list, or an aggregated stream of Tweets. Â The
Twitter API has several endpoints that return a timeline of Tweet data -
