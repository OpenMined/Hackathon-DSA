Overview








This endpoint has been updated to include Tweet edit metadata. Learn more about these metadata on the "Edit Tweets" fundamentals page.Â

This endpoint is often used with the Direct Messages endpoints. We have launched new v2 Direct Messages endpoints. Note that the Enterprise and Premium Account Activity APIs support v2 one-to-one messages, but do not yet support group conversations.Â  Â

The Account Activity API provides you the ability to subscribe to realtime activities related to a user account via webhooks. This means that you can receiveÂ realtime Tweets, Direct Messages, and other account events from one or more of your owned or subscribed accounts through a single connection.


You will receive all related activities below for each user subscription on your webhook registration:




| Activity types |
| --- |
| * Tweets (by user)
* Tweet deletes (by user)
* @mentions (of user)
* Replies (to or from user)
* Retweets (by user or of user)
* Quote Tweets (by user or of user)
* Retweets of Quoted Tweets (by user or of user)
* Likes (by user or of user)
* Follows (by user or of user)
* Unfollows (by user)
 | * Blocks (by user)
* Unblocks (by user)
* Mutes (by user)
* Unmutes (by user)
* Direct Messages sent (by user)
* Direct Messages received (by user)
* Typing indicators (to user)
* Read receipts (to user)
* Subscription revokes (by user)
