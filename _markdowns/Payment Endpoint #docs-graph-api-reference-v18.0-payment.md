| `application` | The app associated with this payment | `App` |
| `actions` | The list of different action types that have occurred in this payment. | object[] |
| `type` | The type of this particular action. `type` can be:* `charge`: This designates the type of action that was taken on this payment was a charge. If the charge has a status of completed, then you should fulfill the order.
* `refund`: The refund type designates the payment has been refunded and the item sold to the consumer should be retracted if possible as you will no longer be paid out for this transaction.
* `chargeback`: A chargeback is initiated by a consumer with their bank disputing the payment in question. When a chargeback occurs, you should retract the in-game item from the costumer where possible as you will not be paid out for this order.
* `chargeback_reversal`: A chargeback\_reversal occurs when a chargeback is retroactively reversed. In this case, you should reinstate the consumer's in-game item if possible as you will now be paid out for this payment.
* `decline`: A decline occurs when a funding source used to create a bundled transaction is declined at the moment of processing the payment. You should retract the in-game item from the consumer where possible as you will not be paid out for this order. More information on bundled transactions and declines can be found in Handling Disputes and Refunds.
 | `string` |

Developers may see initiated state for certain payment methods which requires long time to settle, for example, certain methods require the costumer to fill-in a form online, print out a receipt and go to the bank offline to pay.
* `completed`: A completed status means the action was successfully completed. If the type was a charge you will want to fulfill the order to the consumer at this time. Similarly, if the action type was a refund you will want to retract the item from the consumer.
