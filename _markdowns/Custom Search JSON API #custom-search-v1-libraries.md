Libraries and Samples
=====================




 
 Stay organized with collections
 

 
 Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
 






The Google API client libraries, which are available in a number of popular programming languages, make it easy to use the Custom Search JSON API.


In the following tables, the first column shows each library's stage of development (note that
 some are in early stages), and links to documentation for the library. The second column links to
 available samples for each library.




| Documentation | Samples |
| --- | --- |
| Google API Client Library for Java | Java samples |
| Google API Client Library for JavaScript | JavaScript samples td>
  |
| Google API Client Library for .NET | .NET samples |
| Google API Client Library for Objective-C for REST | Objective-C samples |
| Google API Client Library for PHP () | PHP samples |
| Google API Client Library for Python | Python samples |


These early-stage libraries are also available:




| Documentation | Samples |
| --- | --- |
| Google APIs Client Libraries for Dart (beta) | Dart samples |
| Google API Client Library for Go (alpha) | Go samples |
| Google API Client Library for Node.js (alpha) | Node.js samples td>
  |
| Google API Client Library for Ruby (alpha) | Ruby samples |


Featured samples for this API
-----------------------------


Often, the easiest way to learn how to use an API can be to look at sample code. The table above provides links to some basic samples for each of the languages shown. Currently, there are no additional featured samples available for the Custom Search JSON API.
