Many people want the benefit of hiding replies to improve the quality of
their conversations. Sometimes it's difficult or overwhelming to do so
without help, particularly when people receive a large number of
replies, when those replies contain offensive or abusive language, or
when they want to confine certain conversations to specific groups like
close friends.

This endpoint gives you the ability to programmatically hide or unhide
replies using criteria you define. Just like the functionality in the
main Twitter experience, replies will be hidden from the main
conversation but still visible on a separate page. You can use the
endpoint to create apps to help people hide replies they don't find
valuable.

The hide replies endpoint uses either [OAuth 1.0a User
Context](/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-1-0a) or [OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code with
PKCE](/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)
authentication. If successful, the endpoint hides a single Reply that
was published in a Tweet conversation that was initiated by an
authenticated user. Each conversation supports hiding up to 725 Tweets.
