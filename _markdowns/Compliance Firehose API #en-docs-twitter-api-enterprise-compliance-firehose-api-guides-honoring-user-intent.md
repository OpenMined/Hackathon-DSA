We believe that respecting the privacy and intent of Twitter users is
critically important to the long term health of one of the largest
public, real-time information platforms in the world. Twitter puts
privacy controls in the hands of its users, giving individuals the
ability to control their own Twitter experience. As business consumers
of Twitter data, we have a collective responsibility to honor the
privacy and actions of end users in order to maintain this environment
of trust and respect.\

There are a variety of things that can happen to Tweets and User
accounts that impact how they are displayed on the platform. The actions
that affect privacy and intent are defined at both the Status (Tweet)
and User levels. These actions include:

### User

  ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Action                              Description

  Protect Account                     A Twitter user can protect or unprotect their account at any time. Protected accounts
                                      require manual user approval of every person who is allowed to view their account\'s
                                      Tweets.\
                                      For more information, see [About Public and Protected
                                      Tweets](https://support.twitter.com/articles/14016-about-public-and-protected-tweets) .

  Delete Account                      A Twitter user can decide to delete their account and all associated status messages at
                                      any time. Twitter retains the account information for 30 days after deletion in case
                                      the user decides to undelete and effectively reactivate their account.

  Scrub Geo                           A Twitter user can remove all location data from past Tweets at any time. This known as
                                      "scrub geo".

  Suspend Account                     Twitter retains the right to suspend accounts that are in violation of the Twitter
                                      Rules or if an account is suspected to have been hacked or compromised. Account
                                      suspensions can only be reversed (unsuspend) by Twitter.

  Withhold Account                    Twitter retains the right to reactively withhold access to certain content in a
                                      specific country from time to time. A withheld account can only be made unwithheld by
                                      Twitter.\
                                      For more information, see [Country Withheld
                                      Content](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169222-country-withheld-content) .
  ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Status

  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Action                              Description

  Delete Status                       A Twitter user can delete a status at any point in time. Deleted statuses cannot
                                      be reversed and are permanently deleted.

  Withhold Status                     Twitter retains the right to reactively withhold access to certain content in a
                                      specific country from time to time. A withheld status can only be made unwithheld
                                      by Twitter.\
                                      For more information, see [Country Withheld
                                      Content](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169222-country-withheld-content) .

### Keeping Track of User and Status Changes

The state of a User or Status can change at any time due to one of the
actions above, and this impacts how consumers of Twitter data are
expected to treat the availability and privacy of all associated
content. When these actions happen, a corresponding compliance message
is sent that indicates that the state of a Status or User has changed.
