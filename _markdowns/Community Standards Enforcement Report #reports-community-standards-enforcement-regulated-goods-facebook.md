=================================================

We do not allow private individuals, manufacturers or retailers to buy, sell or trade non-medical drugs, pharmaceutical drugs and marijuana on Facebook and Instagram. We also do not allow private individuals to buy, sell, give, exchange or transfer firearms, including firearm parts or ammunition. While drugs and firearms are regulated by different legal restrictions around the world, we enforce these standards consistently across Instagram due to the borderless nature of our community.

This report does not include data on other goods prohibited from being sold on Facebook or Instagram, including human organs, animals and their parts, or on our enforcement of our separate Commerce Policies or Advertising Policies.

----------

How prevalent were restricted goods and services violations?


 Views of violating content that contains restricted goods and services are very infrequent, and we remove much of this content before people see it. As a result, many times we do not find enough violating samples to precisely estimate prevalence.
 


 In Q3 2023, this was true for violations of our policies on restricted goods and services, suicide and self-injury and terrorism on Facebook and Instagram. In these cases, we can estimate an upper limit of how often someone would see content that violates these policies.
 


 In Q3 2023, the upper limit was 0.05% for violations of our policy for restricted goods and services on Facebook. This means that out of every 10,000 views of content on Facebook, we estimate no more than 5 of those views contained content that violated the policy.

How we calculate itContent actioned is the total number of pieces of content that Facebook took action on for drugs and firearms. It includes both content we actioned after someone reported it, and content that we found proactively.Read about this dataproactive rate

How we calculate itProactive rate is the number of pieces of content acted on that we found and actioned before people using Facebook reported them, divided by the total number of pieces of content we took action on.Read about this dataCorrecting mistakesPeople can appeal our decisions, unless there are extreme safety concerns. We restore content we incorrectly removed or when circumstances change. Restores can happen from appeals or when we identify issues ourselves.

How we calculate itRestored content is the number of pieces of content that we restored during the reporting period after previously actioning it. We restore content both when it is appealed and when we discover issues ourselves.Read about this dataNOTE:Due to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of COVID-19, we could not always offer people the option to appeal. We still gave people the option to tell us they disagreed with our decision, which helped us review many of these instances and restore content when appropriate. Starting in Q2 2022, we updated our methodology for how we count appeals to include all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including after people told us that they disagreed with our decision.
