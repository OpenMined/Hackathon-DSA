Please note: It is highly recommended to use the [Enriched
Native](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/native-enriched-objects/tweet.html)
format for enterprise data APIs.

-   The Enriched Native format includes all new metadata since 2017,
    such as [poll
    metadata](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/enrichments/overview/poll-metadata.html)
    , and additional metrics such as reply_count and quote_count.

-   Activity Streams format has not been updated with new metadata or
    enrichments since the [character
    update](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html)
    in 2017.

Activity Streams is an object schema translation of Twitter\'s [original
data
format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json)
created by Gnip to \'normalize the format\' of Tweet data and other
social media data using the third party [Activity Base Schema described
here](https://activitystrea.ms/head/activity-schema.html) .¬† Tweets are
normalized into the activity streams schema, including: note, person,
place and service object types as nested objects.¬† Tweets can have other
nested Tweet activity obejcts for Retweets, or others including [
twitter_quoted_status ]{.code-inline} , [ long_object ]{.code-inline} .

The base level object type \"activity\" is similar to the [Tweet base
level
object](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/native-enriched-objects/tweet.html)
of the native enriched format.¬† Example payloads in activity streams
format can be found
[here](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/example-payloads.html)
.

In several cases, a Tweet object will included other nested Tweets.¬†¬†If
you are working with nested objects, then that JSON payload will contain
multiple objects, and each Tweet object may contain its own objects. The
root-level object will contain information on the type of action taken,
i.e. whether it is a Retweet or a Quote Tweet, and may also contain an
object that describes the \'original\' Tweet being shared. Extended
Tweets will include a nested extended object that extends beyond 140
characters, which was used to prevent breaking changes when the update
was made in 2017. Each nested object dictionary is described below.
