  [GET /track/:stream](#Stream)   Connect to the data stream
  ------------------------------- ----------------------------

All requests to the PowerTrack API must use HTTP Basic Authentication,
constructed from a valid email address and password combination used to
log into your account at console.gnip.com. Credentials must be passed as
the Authorization header for each request. Make sure your client is
adding the \"Authentication: Basic\" HTTP header (with encoded
credentials over HTTPS) to all API requests.

## GET /track/:stream []{#Stream .tall} [Â¶](#get-track-stream-){.headerlink} {#get-track-stream-}

Establishes a persistent connection to the PowerTrack data stream,
through which the social data will be delivered.

**IMPORTANT:** After you establish the connection [see
here](/en/docs/tutorials/consuming-streaming-data) for details on
consuming streaming data.

|                                   | page of your console dashboard,   |
|                                   | and resembles the following       |
|                                   | structure:                        |
