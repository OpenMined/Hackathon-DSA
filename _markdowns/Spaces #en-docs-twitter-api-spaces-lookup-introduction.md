The Spaces lookup endpoints help you lookup live or scheduled Spaces,
and enable you to build discovery experiences to give your users ways to
find Spaces they may be interested in.

The lookup by ID endpoints return data you can use to build experiences
to display Spaces information to your users, or return details about one
or more Spaces. You can lookup one or more Spaces in the same request.

You can also lookup Spaces by their creator ID. This endpoint is useful
to lookup Spaces from users in a list, or to determine if multiple
recurring hosts are live now or have an upcoming Space scheduled. Up to
100 users can be looked up in a single request.
