This is an overview of Twitter's enterprise console dashboard. The
sections that are covered pertain to each specific area of the console
for product details, usage, and general account management. If you have
any questions regarding your specific account, please contact your
designated account manager, or review our [technical documentation for
enterprise products](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise.html) .

As part of the enterprise trial and onboarding process with your account
manager, enterprise customers will receive a login to
[console.gnip.com](http://console.gnip.com) , which is the user
interface where enterprise product access can be reviewed and
configured. Initial access to the console for customer admin is set up
by Twitter as part of the enterprise onboarding process, and admins can
then add additional users. The enterprise console allows you to manage
and access more details related to your enterprise products.

The following video provides an overview of the various portions of the
console.gnip.com dashboard.

**Disclaimer: Please note that some of the features shown in the video,
including certain stream enrichments and non-Twitter data source
products, may no longer be available.**
