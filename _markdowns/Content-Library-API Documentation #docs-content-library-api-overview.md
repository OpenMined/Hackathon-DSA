Overview
========


Meta Content Library API provides access to real-time data from public discussions on Facebook and Instagram, equipping researchers to study existing topics of interest as well as understand evolving or emerging topics on our platforms.


Welcome Guide
-------------


We’re excited for you to examine Meta Content Library API data on the Researcher Platform to support your research endeavor! The Welcome Guide linked below provides an overview of the Content Library API and Researcher Platform and includes links to more detailed information in the user documentation. We recommend you view this guide first before exploring further. Click here to access the Welcome Guide (PDF).

  
  
Please note that the product(s) and Welcome Guide may be revised from time to time, so check back regularly for the latest version.


Content Library API client
--------------------------


You access the API through our Content Library API Client. The client runs on Jupyter, with which you can create a Jupyter notebook. Once created, you can import our Python3 or R Content Library API client module which allows you to perform queries against the API. See Getting started.


The Content Library API Client allows you to access a variety of fields on the following data. Information and content from public entities listed below will be returned; however, certain data that could potentially identify users (such as tags) will be redacted or omitted in API responses.


* Facebook Page
* Facebook group
* Facebook event
* Facebook post
* Instagram business or creator account
* Instagram post


VPN
---


You access the API through our virtual private network (VPN) using OpenVPN. Follow the OpenVPN Setup instructions in Getting started to learn how to install and configure the OpenVPN client.


Data dictionary
---------------


We provide a detailed Data dictionary that describes the data names displayed in the Meta Content Library (the Name column) if applicable, and the corresponding API fields returned in Content Library API search responses (the API field column).


Meta Content Library
--------------------


Meta Content Library is a web-based tool that allows researchers to explore and understand data across Facebook and Instagram by offering a comprehensive, visual, searchable collection of publicly available content—the same content that is also accessible through the Content Library API. The web-based user interface allows you to explore data, test out search parameters, and assess whether the resulting data is appropriate for your planned research. No knowledge of query or programming languages is needed.

Code examples
-------------


Code examples in this documentation use a tabbed code block with tabs for R and Python. Click the tab for the language of your choice to display the appropriate code. This is an example:


RPython
```
Click the R tab to display R code here
```

```
Click the Python tab to display Python code here
```
You can copy the code in either tab and paste it into a Jupyter notebook cell for the same language (R or Python).
