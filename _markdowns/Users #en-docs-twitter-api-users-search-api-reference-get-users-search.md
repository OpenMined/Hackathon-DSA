| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query`
¬†Required¬† | string | One query for matching Tweets. You can learn how to build this query by reading our build a query guide.

If you have Essential or Elevated access, you can use the Basic operators when building your query and can make queries up to 512 characters long. If you have been approved for Academic Research access, you can use all available operators and can make queries up to 1,024 characters long.

Learn more about our access levels on the about Twitter API page. |
| `expansions`
¬†Optional¬† | enum (`pinned_tweet_id`) | Expansions enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned users. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the user data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the `includes` response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object. At this time, the only expansion available to endpoints that primarily return user objects is `expansions=pinned_tweet_id`. You will find the expanded Tweet data object living in the `includes` response object. |
| `max_results`
¬†Optional¬† | integer | The maximum number of search results to be returned by a request. A number between 1 and 1000. By default, a request response will return 100 results. |
| `next_token`
¬†Optional¬† | string | This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results. The value used with the parameter is pulled directly from the response provided by the API, and should not be modified. |
| `tweet.fields`
¬†Optional¬† | enum (`attachments`, `author_id`, `context_annotations`, `conversation_id`, `created_at`, `edit_controls`, `entities`, `geo`, `id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `lang`, `non_public_metrics`, `public_metrics`, `organic_metrics`, `promoted_metrics`, `possibly_sensitive`, `referenced_tweets`, `reply_settings`, `source`, `text`, `withheld`) | This fields parameter enables you to select which specific Tweet fields will deliver in each returned pinned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet fields will only return if the user has a pinned Tweet and if you've also included the `expansions=pinned_tweet_id` query parameter in your request. While the referenced Tweet ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional Tweet fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `user.fields`
¬†Optional¬† | enum (`created_at`, `description`, `entities`, `id`, `location`, `most_recent_tweet_id`, `name`, `pinned_tweet_id`, `profile_image_url`, `protected`, `public_metrics`, `url`, `username`, `verified`, `verified_type`, `withheld`) | This fields parameter enables you to select which specific user fields will deliver with each returned users objects. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. These specified user fields will display directly in the user data objects. |
