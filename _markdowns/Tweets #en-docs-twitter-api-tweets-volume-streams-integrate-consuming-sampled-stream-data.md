Consuming data from the sampled stream is very similar to the filtered
stream integration recommendations.Â  For understanding how to consume
from a streaming endpoint, please follow the recommendations given in
the consuming streaming data integration guide, and note the following
differences with sampled stream.

-   Although only 1% of Tweets, the volume of the sampled stream can be
    very high, and your client should have a high volume capacity.
-   Tweets delivered through the sampled stream endpoint do not count
    towards the monthly total Tweet volume.
-   Tweets delivered with sampled stream will not have a matching rules
    object.\

**Best Practices**

When consuming realtime data, maximizing your connection time is a
fundamental goal to promote both data reliability and data
full-fidelity. When disconnects occur, it is important for your client
to automatically detect the disconnection, [handle the
disconnection](/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/sampled-stream/integrate/handling-disconnections)
and reconnect quickly.
