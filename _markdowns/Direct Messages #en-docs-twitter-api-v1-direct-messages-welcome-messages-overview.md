Overview



Welcome Messages provide the ability to display a message to people who are entering a Direct Message conversation. Welcome messages can be customized for different referral paths. For example, users who click on Direct Message links in a Tweet or if a user enters a Direct Message view for the first time with no prior context. Welcome Messages can contain any content that a Direct Message would, including media, Quick Replies, and more.


Welcome Messages can be presented to users in two ways:


* Deeplinking to a Welcome Message  

Create a URL that can be used anywhere to link a user to a specific message in the Direct Message view.
* Setting a Default Welcome Message  

Set the default message a user will see when they enter the Direct Message view.
