The [Rest.li protocol](https://linkedin.github.io/rest.li/spec/protocol)
defines 14 resource methods as a higher-level abstraction on top of the
standard HTTP methods, each with its own standardized interface and
intended semantics.

For example, to retrieve one or more entities, any one of these Rest.li
methods can be implemented for a resource, depending on the use case:
[GET](../api-guide/concepts/methods#get) ,
[BATCH_GET](../api-guide/concepts/methods#batch_get) ,
[GET_ALL](../api-guide/concepts/methods#get_all) ,
[FINDER](../api-guide/concepts/methods#finder-findername) , or
[BATCH_FINDER](../api-guide/concepts/methods#batch_finder-findername) .
Each of those Rest.li methods would have its own standard request and
response interfaces.

The Rest.li protocol also supports complex resource keys and query
parameters, and it has a custom protocol for encoding them.

Nearly all of LinkedIn\'s APIs are built on the Rest.li framework with
additional LinkedIn-specific details, which results in a robust yet
complex protocol that can be challenging to implement correctly.

## API Client Overview

To simplify development, we have released API client libraries in the
following languages, each of which contains comprehensive documentation
and examples in their corresponding GitHub repository:

Note that these client libraries do not support specific APIs - they
provide an abstraction on top of the Rest.li protocol, making it easier
to construct API requests to LinkedIn. This simplifies the process for
you to build your higher-level clients for specific APIs.

Some of the key features of the LinkedIn API Client Libraries include:

-   RestliClient with support for all Rest.li methods
-   AuthClient with support for token creation/management
-   Typed interfaces to enable code completion and inline documentation
    in IDEs
-   Rest.li protocol 2.0 support
-   Automatic key/query parameter encoding
-   Support for versioned APIs
-   Automatic [query tunneling](../api-guide/concepts/query-tunneling)
    of requests, if required

## Example

To illustrate the benefits of using these API clients, consider
[searching for ad
accounts](../../marketing/integrations/ads/account-structure/create-and-manage-accounts#search-for-accounts)
using our Advertising API. For a NodeJS application using an HTTP client
library like [axios](https://axios-http.com/) , there are quite a few
details to get right to perform a working request, as shown in the
following sample code: base URL, resource prefix, auth and custom
headers, and correct encoding of complex query parameters. The result
can be difficult to write and maintain and doesn't account for edge
cases requiring query tunneling.

``` lang-javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const ACCESS_TOKEN = "AQX5â€¦";
const API_VERSION = '202302';

// Define a generic function to search ad accounts by references
function searchForAdAccountsByReferences(
 references,
 count = 10,
 sortField = 'ID',
 sortOrder = 'ASCENDING'
) {
 return axios.request({
   baseURL: 'https://api.linkedin.com',
   url: '/rest/adAccounts',
   method: 'get',
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
     'X-RestLi-Method': 'finder',
     'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version': '2.0.0',
     'Connection': 'Keep-Alive',
     'LinkedIn-Version': API_VERSION
   },
   params: {
     q: 'search',
     search: `(reference:(values:List(${references.map(encodeURIComponent).join(',')})))`,
     count,
     sort: `(field:${sortField},order:${sortOrder})`
   },
   paramsSerializer: {
     // Can't use default encoding
     encode: (val) => val
   }
 }).then(response => response.data.elements);
}

// Search for ad accounts by a list of organizations, with up to 20 results
const orgs = ['urn:li:organization:123', 'urn:li:organization:456'];
searchForAdAccountsByReferences(orgs, 20).then(adAccounts => {
 console.log(adAccounts);
});
```

Compare that to this code utilizing the LinkedIn API client. The client
abstracts much of the complexities of constructing the request. It
allows passing in objects, arrays, and strings with special characters
as is, making the code easy to write and maintain. Furthermore, it
handles edge cases where query tunneling may be required.

``` lang-javascript
const { RestliClient } = require('linkedin-api-client');

const restliClient = new RestliClient();
const ACCESS_TOKEN = "AQX5...";
const API_VERSION = '202302';

// Define a generic function to search ad accounts by references
function searchForAdAccountsByReferences(
  references,
  count = 10,
  sortField = 'ID',
  sortOrder = 'ASCENDING'
) {
  return restliClient.finder({
    resourcePath: '/adAccounts',
    finderName: 'search',
    queryParams: {
      search: {
        reference: {
          values: references
        },
      },
      count,
      sort: {
        field: sortField,
        order: sortOrder
      }
    },
    versionString: API_VERSION,
    accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN
  }).then(response => response.data.elements);
}

// Search for ad accounts by a list of organizations, with up to 20 results
const orgs = ['urn:li:organization:123', 'urn:li:organization:456'];
searchForAdAccountsByReferences(orgs, 20).then(adAccounts => {
  console.log(adAccounts);
});
```

In summary, using these API clients can speed up and simplify the
development process and make your application code maintainable and
robust. If any issues arise, the corresponding Github repository is
available for bug reports and enhancement suggestions.
