===========

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook and Instagram. We define hate speech as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, calls for exclusion or segregation based on protected characteristics or slurs. These characteristics include race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity and serious disability or disease.

When the intent is clear, we may allow people to share someone else's hate speech content to raise awareness or discuss whether the speech is appropriate to use, to use slurs self-referentially in an effort to reclaim the term or for other similar reasons.

Content actioned decreased from 18 million in Q2 2023 to 9.6 million in Q3 2023, returning to pre-Q2 levels following an increase in enforcement on non-violating content due to a bug in our proactive detection technology that was later fixed and the content was restored. This impacted both platforms in Q2.

How we calculate itRestored content is the number of pieces of content that we restored during the reporting period after previously actioning it. We restore content both when it is appealed and when we discover issues ourselves.Read about this dataNOTE:Due to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of COVID-19, we could not always offer people the option to appeal. We still gave people the option to tell us they disagreed with our decision, which helped us review many of these instances and restore content when appropriate. Starting in Q2 2022, we updated our methodology for how we count appeals to include all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including after people told us that they disagreed with our decision.
