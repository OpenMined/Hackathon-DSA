| `redirect` | The `picture` edge is a special case, as when requested, it will by default return the picture itself and not a JSON response. To return a JSON response, you need to set `redirect=false` as a request attribute. This is how to return the fields below. | `bool` |
| `type` | You can use this to get a pre-specified size of picture. | `enum{small, normal, large, square}` |
