The Twitter API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze
Twitter data, as well as build for the conversation on Twitter.

Over the years, the Twitter API has grown by adding additional levels of
access for developers and academic researchers to be able to scale their
access to enhance and research the public conversation.

Recently, we released the Twitter API v2. The Twitter API v2 includes a
modern foundation, new and advanced features, and quick onboarding to
[Basic access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/basic) .
\

The following three tabs explain the different versions and access
levels of the Twitter API, what's new with v2, and which Twitter
resources you can retrieve, create, destroy, and adjust using the API. \

Twitter API, or review our [Getting access to the Twitter
API](/en1/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)
guide for more details.

We've also put together a guide describing [how to make your first
request](/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/make-your-first-request)
to the Twitter API.

If you have any feedback on these getting started resources, we'd love
to hear from you!\
