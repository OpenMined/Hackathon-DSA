Below is a list of all operators supported in Twitter\'s [ enterprise
]{.subscription-tag .subscription-tag--enterprise} real-time and
historical PowerTrack APIs.\

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Operator                          | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| keyword\                          | Matches a keyword within the body |
|                                   | of a Tweet. This is a tokenized   |
|                                   | match, meaning that your keyword  |
|                                   | string will be matched against    |
|                                   | the tokenized text of the Tweet   |
|                                   | body -- tokenization is based on  |
|                                   | punctuation, symbol, and          |
|                                   | separator Unicode basic plane     |
|                                   | characters. For example, a Tweet  |
|                                   | with the text "I like coca-cola"  |
|                                   | would be split into the following |
|                                   | tokens: I, like, coca, cola.      |
|                                   | These tokens would then be        |
|                                   | compared to the keyword string    |
|                                   | used in your rule. To match       |
|                                   | strings containing punctuation    |
|                                   | (for example, coca-cola), symbol, |
|                                   | or separator characters, you must |
|                                   | use a quoted exact match as       |
|                                   | described below.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** This operator will      |
|                                   | match on both URLs and unwound    |
|                                   | URLs within a Tweet.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| emoji\                            | Matches an emoji within the body  |
|                                   | of a Tweet. Emojis are a          |
|                                   | tokenized match, meaning that     |
|                                   | your emoji will be matched        |
|                                   | against the tokenized text of the |
|                                   | Tweet body -- tokenization is     |
|                                   | based on punctuation,             |
|                                   | symbol/emoji, and separator       |
|                                   | Unicode basic plane characters.   |
|                                   | For example, a Tweet with the     |
|                                   | text "I like üçï" would be split   |
|                                   | into the following tokens: I,     |
|                                   | like, üçï. These tokens would then |
|                                   | be compared to the emoji used in  |
|                                   | your rule. Note that if an emoji  |
|                                   | has a variant, you must use       |
|                                   | "quotations" to add to a rule.\   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| \"exact phrase match\"\           | Matches an exact phrase within    |
|                                   | the body of a Tweet.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** In 30 Day Search and    |
|                                   | Full Archive Search, punctuation  |
|                                   | is not tokenized and is instead   |
|                                   | treated as whitespace. For        |
|                                   | example,¬†quoted "#hashtag" will   |
|                                   | match "hashtag" but not #hashtag  |
|                                   | (use the hashtag \# operator      |
|                                   | without quotes to match on actual |
|                                   | hashtags                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, quoted "\$cashtag"   |
|                                   | will match "cashtag" but not      |
|                                   | \$cashtag (use the cashtag \$     |
|                                   | operator without quotes to match  |
|                                   | on actual cashtags                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** This operator will      |
|                                   | match on both URLs and unwound    |
|                                   | URLs within a Tweet.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| \#\                               | Matches any Tweet with the given  |
|                                   | hashtag.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This operator performs an exact   |
|                                   | match, NOT a tokenized match,     |
|                                   | meaning the rule "2016" will      |
|                                   | match posts with the exact        |
|                                   | hashtag "2016", but not those     |
|                                   | with the hashtag "2016election"   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Note: that the hashtag operator   |
|                                   | relies on Twitter's entity        |
|                                   | extraction to match hashtags,     |
|                                   | rather than extracting the        |
|                                   | hashtag from the body itself.¬†See |

| sample:                           | Returns a random sample of Tweets |
|                                   | that match a rule rather than the |
|                                   | entire set of Tweets. Sample      |
|                                   | percent must be represented by an |
|                                   | integer value between 1 and 100.  |
|                                   | This operator applies to the      |
|                                   | entire rule and requires any      |
|                                   | "OR'd" terms be grouped.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Important Note:** The sample    |
|                                   | operator first reduces the scope  |
|                                   | of the firehose to X%, then the   |
|                                   | rule/filter is applied to that    |
|                                   | sampled subset. If you are using, |
|                                   | for example, **sample:10** , each |
|                                   | Tweet has a 10% chance of being   |
|                                   | in the sample.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Also, the sampling is             |
|                                   | deterministic, and you will get   |
|                                   | the same data sample in realtime  |
|                                   | as you would if you pulled the    |
