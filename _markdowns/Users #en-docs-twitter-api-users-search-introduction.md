The Users Search endpoint provides a simple, relevance-based search interface to public user accounts on X. Try querying by topical interest, full name, company name, location, or other criteria.  




This endpoint currently supports User Auth . By default, you get 100 Users per request and you can specify up to 1000 Users per request. It has a limit of 10,000 requests per 24 hours (in addition to the 300 requests per 15 minutes)











**Account setup**


To access these endpoints, you will need:


* An approved developer account.
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a developer App that is located within a Project.
