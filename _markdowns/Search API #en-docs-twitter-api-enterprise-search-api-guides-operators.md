| Operator                          | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| keyword\                          | Matches a tokenized keyword       |
|                                   | within the body or urls of a      |
|                                   | Tweet. This is a tokenized match, |
|                                   | meaning that your keyword string  |
|                                   | will be matched against the       |
|                                   | tokenized text of the Tweet body  |
|                                   | -- tokenization is based on       |
|                                   | punctuation, symbol, and          |
|                                   | separator Unicode basic plane     |
|                                   | characters. For example, a Tweet  |
|                                   | with the text "I like coca-cola"  |
|                                   | would be split into the following |
|                                   | tokens: I, like, coca, cola.      |
|                                   | These tokens would then be        |
|                                   | compared to the keyword string    |
|                                   | used in your rule. To match       |
|                                   | strings containing punctuation    |
|                                   | (for example, coca-cola), symbol, |
|                                   | or separator characters, you must |
|                                   | use a quoted exact match as       |
|                                   | described below.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** With the Search API,    |
|                                   | accented and special characters   |
|                                   | are normalized to standard latin  |
|                                   | characters, which can change      |
|                                   | meanings in foreign languages or  |
|                                   | return unexpected results:        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example,¬†\"m√∫sic\" will match |
|                                   | "music" and vice versa.\          |
|                                   | For example,¬†common phrases like  |
|                                   | \"Feliz A√±o Nuevo!\" in Spanish,  |
|                                   | would be indexed as \"Feliz Ano   |
|                                   | Nuevo\", which changes the        |
|                                   | meaning of the phrase.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** This operator will      |
|                                   | match on both URLs and unwound    |
|                                   | URLs within a Tweet.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| emoji\                            | Matches an emoji within the body  |
|                                   | of a Tweet. Emojis are a          |
|                                   | tokenized match, meaning that     |
|                                   | your emoji will be matched        |
|                                   | against the tokenized text of the |
|                                   | Tweet body -- tokenization is     |
|                                   | based on punctuation,             |
|                                   | symbol/emoji, and separator       |
|                                   | Unicode basic plane characters.   |
|                                   | For example, a Tweet with the     |
|                                   | text "I like üçï" would be split   |
|                                   | into the following tokens: I,     |
|                                   | like, üçï. These tokens would then |
|                                   | be compared to the emoji used in  |
|                                   | your rule. Note that if an emoji  |
|                                   | has a variant, you must use       |
|                                   | "quotations" to add to a rule.\   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| \"exact phrase match\"\           | Matches the tokenized and ordered |
|                                   | phrase within the body or urls of |
|                                   | a Tweet.¬†This is a tokenized      |
|                                   | match, meaning that your keyword  |
|                                   | string will be matched against    |
|                                   | the tokenized text of the Tweet   |
|                                   | body -- tokenization is based on  |
|                                   | punctuation, symbol, and          |
|                                   | separator Unicode basic plane     |
|                                   | characters.\                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** Punctuation is not      |
|                                   | tokenized and is instead treated  |
|                                   | as whitespace. For                |
|                                   | example,¬†quoted "#hashtag" will   |
|                                   | match "hashtag" but not #hashtag  |
|                                   | (use the hashtag \# operator      |
|                                   | without quotes to match on actual |
|                                   | hashtags. For example,¬†quoted     |
|                                   | "\$cashtag" will match "cashtag"  |
|                                   | but not \$cashtag (use the        |
|                                   | cashtag \$ operator without       |
|                                   | quotes to match on actual         |

|                                   | For example,¬†\"Love Snow\" will   |
|                                   | match \"#love #snow\"\            |
|                                   | For example,¬†\"#Love #Snow\" will |
