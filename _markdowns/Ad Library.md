For ads targeted to the EU, the Ad Library includes additional information, including information about ad impressions, ad targeting and dates the ad ran.
 




### What are all the ad formats supported by LinkedIn?






 To learn more about the ad formats available on LinkedIn, see the LinkedIn Ads Guide.
 




### How long does it take for an ad to be available on the Ad Library?

### How far back can I search ads?






 The Ad Library allows users to search ads that were created on or after June 1, 2023.
 




### How are dates and times recorded in the Ad Library?






 All dates and timestamps are recorded in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

### How is ad targeting in the Ad Library determined?






 For ads targeted to the EU, the Ad Library shows the top three targeting parameters selected by the advertiser in when targeting their ad. Learn more.
 




### Can I opt out from my ads showing up in the Ad Library?

### What are brand partnerships and where can I search them?






 LinkedIn creators can label when their organic posts contain brand partnerships, to signal they have a relationship with the brand. You can search organic posts creators have marked as brand partnerships here. These posts are organic member posts labeled by the creator, not LinkedIn ads.
 




### I have a question not answered here. Where can I find help?
