Introduction



Introduction
------------


This List lookup group has two available endpoints. You are able to retrieve a specified List by ID and get details on user-owned Lists. With the Lists endpoints, you can build solutions that enable people to curate and organize Tweets based on preferences, interests, groups, or topics. 


There is a rate limit of 75 requests per 15 minutes when looking up a specified List by ID and a limit of 15 requests per 15 minutes when looking up user-owned Lists.


You can use OAuth 1.0a User Context, App only, or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE to authenticate your requests to these endpoints. 











**Account setup**


To access these endpoints, you will need:


* An approved developer account.
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a developer App that is located within a Project.


Learn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our getting started guide.
