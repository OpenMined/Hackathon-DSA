ThreatExchange UI Privacy Groups Tab
====================================

The **Privacy Groups** tab shows the Privacy Groups in ThreatExchange and allows for detailed viewing of each group and editing actions (if available).


  
Click **View** next to each Privacy Group entry to show the detailed page. From this page, you can see additional information about the privacy group and a documentation link.


  
Privacy Groups that you have access to change will have an **Edit** button. Click **Edit** to change the name, description, visibility and joining settings, and member apps. It also displays a documentation link.

  
Click **Create** to create a new Privacy Group. You can select the name, descriptions, joining and visibility settings, and who can use it. You can not select the owner App ID or the owner app name; this is autogenerated for you. An example of this popup is shown below.
