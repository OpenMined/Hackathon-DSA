The Usage Tab provides insight into your use of your streams over
various time periods. For programmatic access to usage information, see
the [Usage API](/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/usage-api/overview.html)
.

### Monthly

The Monthly Usage page displays your stream usage broken down by
product. For example, coverage products (for example, PowerTrack,
Historical PowerTrack, and PowerTrack Replay) for a given data source
will be grouped together to provide separate data, as well as a combined
roll-up count. The counts include a current month-to-date, estimated
end-of-month (based on this month's usage so far, and remaining time in
the month), and the previous two months' counts.

Notably, these counts are deduplicated for each product and stream. If
you received the same Tweet through multiple connections to the same
PowerTrack stream, that Tweet will be counted once for these purposes.
Counts will be updated every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC.

### Daily

The Daily Usage page provides daily deduplicated counts for each day in
the current month, broken down by product. Counts are updated every 24
hours at 00:00 UTC.

### Rules

Rule limits are based on your contracted PowerTrack rule package and are
applied across all streams of a given \"type\". Counts are updated
whenever a new rule is added or deleted.
