Bookmarks are a core feature of the Twitter app that allows you to
"save" Tweets and easily access them later. With these endpoints, you
can retrieve, create, delete or build solutions to manage your Bookmarks
via the API.

### Manage Bookmarks

We have two available methods for manage Bookmarks, POST and DELETE. The
POST method lets you create Bookmarks. Likewise, the DELETE method
allows you to delete a specific Bookmark.

There is a per-user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes for the
POST and DELETE methods.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the manage
Bookmarks endpoints, you must authenticate by generating a user Access
Token with OAuth 2.0. You can use the [Authorization Code with PKCE
grant
flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token)
to do so. To use this endpoint you must pass in the scopes
` tweet.read ` , ` users.read ` , and ` bookmark.write ` .

### Bookmarks lookup

The Bookmarks lookup endpoint has one method available, GET. This method
allows you to get Bookmarks back from yourself or an authenticated
account. Pagination tokens will be provided for paging through large
sets of results for this endpoint.

There is a per-user rate limit of 180 requests per 15 min window for the
GET method.Â With this endpoint you will get back 800 of your most recent
Bookmarked Tweets.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the lookup
Bookmarks endpoints, you must authenticate by generating a user Access
Token with OAuth 2.0. You can use the [Authorization Code with PKCE
grant
flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token)
to do so. To use this endpoint you must pass in the scopes
` tweet.read ` , ` users.read ` , and ` bookmark.read ` .
