This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the
full-archive search endpoint with a set of specified fields using
Postman.

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please
visit our [Twitter API v2 sample
code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)
GitHub¬†repository.\

The full-archive search endpoint is currently available as part of the
Pro and Enterprise access only. In order to use this endpoint, you must
upgrade to Pro access or [apply for Enterprise access
level](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform)
.

In addition to being approved for access,¬†you will need to have a set of
[keys and tokens](/en/docs/authentication) to authenticate your request.
You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

-   Navigate to your
    [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) with
    Enterprise or Pro access¬†in the developer portal and make sure you
    have an associated [developer
    App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that
    Project.\
-   Navigate to your App\'s "Keys and tokens" page to generate the
    required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure
    location.

### Steps to build a full-archive search request

#### Step one: Start with a tool or library

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you
can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the
Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please
click on the following button:
:::
:::

::: b03-button-v3
[](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman){.chirp-btn .twtr-spacing--mb-500
.chirp-btn--primary .chirp-btn--icon .chirp-btn--icon-end
.twtr-scribe-clicks}

::: chirp-btn__icon

:::

Add Twitter API v2 to Postman
:::

::: c01-rich-text-editor
::: is-table-default
\
Once you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate
to the Search Tweets \> Full-archive search request.

#### Step two: Authenticate your request

To properly make a request to the Twitter API, you need to verify that
you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate
your request with the [OAuth 2.0
App-Only](/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only)
authentication methods.

You must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access
Token](/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) (also known as
the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the
environment named "Twitter API v2" in the top-right corner of Postman
and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current
value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment
dropdown).

This variable will automatically be pulled into the request\'s
authorization tab if you\'ve done this correctly.\

#### Step three: Create a search query

Each full-archive search query requires a single search query. For this
example, we are going to use a query that matches on Tweets posted by
the \@XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from operator and
set it to XDevelopers (case insensitive):

` from:XDevelopers `

In Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this ID, or a
string of Tweet IDs separated by a comma, into the \"Value\" column of
the ` ids ` parameter.\

  Key         Value                  Description
  ----------- ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  ` query `   ` from:XDevelopers `   Search query to submit to the full-archive search endpoint

\
Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve
\

If you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the
default [Tweet
object](/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) fields
in your response: ` id ` , ` text ` , and [ edit_history_tweet_ids
]{.code-inline} . Note that if you receive Tweets from before editing
was supported, the [ edit_history_tweet_ids ]{.code-inline} field will
not be provided. No history backfill was performed for this field.

If you would like to receive additional fields beyond these default
fields,¬†you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [
[field](/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) ]{.code-inline} and/or [
[expansion](/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) ]{.code-inline} parameters.

For this exercise, we will request a four different sets of fields from
different objects:

1.  The default Tweet object fields
2.  The additional [ tweet.created_at ]{.code-inline} field in the
    primary user objects
3.  The associated authors' [user
    object's](/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)
    default fields for the returned Tweets
4.  The additional [ user.description ]{.code-inline} field in the
    associated user objects\

In Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following
key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:

  Key                             Value                           Returned fields
  ------------------------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ` tweet.fields `                ` created_at `                  ` tweets.created_at `
  ` expansions `                  ` author_id `                   [ includes.users.id ]{.code-inline} , [ includes.users.name ]{.code-inline} , [ includes.users.username ]{.code-inline}
  [ user.fields ]{.code-inline}   [ description ]{.code-inline}   [ includes.users.description ]{.code-inline}

You should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:
:::
:::

::: {.b19-code-snippet .twtr-component-space--md}
::: {.b19-snippet .b19__theme--light}
::: t05-inline-code-snippet
``` {.line-numbers .t05__pre--with-button}
 https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all?query=from:XDevelopers&tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at
    
```
:::
:::
:::

::: dtc09-callout-text
::: dtc09-callout-text
::: dtc09__item
::: dtc09__text
::: c01-rich-text-editor
::: is-table-default
**Please note**

By default, only 10 most recent Tweets will be returned. If you want
more than 10 Tweets per request, you can use the [ max_results
]{.code-inline} parameter and set it to a maximum of 500 Tweets per
request. Similarly,¬† by default Tweets from the last 30 days will be
returned. If you want to get Tweets that are older than 30 days, you can
use the [ start_time ]{.code-inline} and [ end_time ]{.code-inline}
parameters in your API call.
