Twitter will now begin to enforce long-held contractual limits for the
number of rules that a customer is able to add to their stream by
enforcing rule limits on PowerTrack. While these limits have always been
observed, we are now making it easier for customers to know where their
limits stand and how close they are to their cap. Functionality has been
added to our console that will allow you to observe your current rule
count for each product and stream. This information can be found on the
right hand side of a product page just under the activity counter (see
below).

If you attempt to upload more rules to your stream that you are
contractually allowed, you will receive the following message:

*"Request exceeds account's Rule Limit. Delete rules or contact your
account manager to proceed."*

If you encounter this error message while you have an open connection,
your stream will not be disrupted. In order to add more rules once you
hit your cap, you will either need to delete rules from your stream or
reach out to your account manager to increase your contractual limit.
