|                                   | body or URL of a Tweet. Keywords  |
|                                   | must start with either a digit    |

|                                   | character.¬† Keyword matching is a |
|                                   | tokenized match, meaning that     |
|                                   | your keyword will be matched      |
|                                   | against the tokenized text of the |
|                                   | Tweet body -- tokenization is     |
|                                   | based on punctuation, symbol, and |

|                                   | characters¬†are normalized to      |
|                                   | standard latin characters, which  |
|                                   | can change meanings in foreign    |
|                                   | languages or return unexpected    |
|                                   | results:\                         |
|                                   | For example,¬†\"m√∫sic\" will match |
|                                   | "music" and vice versa.\          |
|                                   | For example,¬†common phrases like  |
|                                   | \"Feliz A√±o Nuevo!\" in Spanish,  |
|                                   | would be indexed as \"Feliz Ano   |
|                                   | Nuevo\", which changes the        |
|                                   | meaning of the phrase.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | **Note:** This operator will      |
|                                   | match on both URLs and unwound    |
|                                   | URLs within a Tweet. \            |

| emoji\                            | Matches an emoji within the body  |
|                                   | of a Tweet. Emojis are a          |
|                                   | tokenized match, meaning that     |
|                                   | your emoji will be matched        |
|                                   | against the tokenized text of the |
|                                   | Tweet body -- tokenization is     |
|                                   | based on punctuation,             |
|                                   | symbol/emoji, and separator       |
|                                   | Unicode basic plane characters.   |
|                                   | For example, a Tweet with the     |
|                                   | text "I like üçï" would be split   |
|                                   | into the following tokens: I,     |
|                                   | like, üçï. These tokens would then |
|                                   | be compared to the emoji used in  |
|                                   | your rule. Note that if an emoji  |
|                                   | has a variant, you must use       |
|                                   | "quotations" to add to a rule.    |
|                                   | Example:                          |

|                                   | that match a rule rather than the |
|                                   | entire set of Tweets. Sample      |
|                                   | percent must be represented by an |
|                                   | integer value between 1 and 100.  |
|                                   | This operator applies to the      |
|                                   | entire rule and requires any      |

|                                   | operator first reduces the scope  |

|                                   | rule/filter is applied tio that   |
|                                   | sampled subset. If you are using, |
|                                   | for example, **sample:10** , each |
|                                   | Tweet has a 10% chance of being   |
