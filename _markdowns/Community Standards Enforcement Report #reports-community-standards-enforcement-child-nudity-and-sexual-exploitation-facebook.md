=====================================================================

We do not allow content that endangers children, such as content that contains nudity or physical abuse or content that sexually exploits children on Facebook and Instagram. When we find this type of violating content, we remove it, regardless of the context or the person's motivation for sharing it. We may also disable the account of the person who shared it, unless it appears the intent was not malicious (for example, to spread awareness of child exploitation).

We report apparent child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a nonprofit that refers cases to law enforcement globally, in compliance with US law. We choose to remove content depicting non-sexualized child nudity to reduce the potential for abuse of the content by others.

How we calculate itRestored content is the number of pieces of content that we restored during the reporting period after previously actioning it. We restore content both when it is appealed and when we discover issues ourselves.Read about this dataNOTE:Due to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of COVID-19, we could not always offer people the option to appeal. We still gave people the option to tell us they disagreed with our decision, which helped us review many of these instances and restore content when appropriate. Starting in Q2 2022, we updated our methodology for how we count appeals to include all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including after people told us that they disagreed with our decision.
