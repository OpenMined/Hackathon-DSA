**On September 17th, 2018 we retired the legacy Direct Message
endpoints.\
If you had been using those endpoints, please make sure to migrate over
to the new Direct Message endpoints or the Account Activity API.**

**Please review [this
announcment](https://twittercommunity.com/t/details-and-what-to-expect-from-the-api-deprecations-this-week-on-august-16-2018/110746)
to learn more.**

This guide is designed to help you migrate from legacy Direct Message
REST APIs to their enhanced replacements which have graduated from beta.
Below you will find a summary of the changes, a new features list, and
key differences and considerations to help with the transition. The new
Direct Message endpoints are available now to all developers. For
guidance in migrating from User Streams or Site Streams, see the
[migration guide to Account Activity
API](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/migration/us-ss-migration-guide)
.

### []{#summary} Summary of changes

If you are still using the following DM endpoints, you will have to
migrate to the newer endpoints.

### []{#features} New features

The new Direct Message API endpoints support a number of new
capabilities and provide improved access to previous Direct Messages.
New features include:

-   Support for media attachments (image, GIF,Â and video).
-   Ability to prompt users for structured replies with a predefined
    options list.
-   Up to 30 days of access to past Direct Messages.

For a full list of new Direct Message features and additional new API
endpoints refer to the [technical
documentation](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/overview)
.\

### []{#differences} Differences & migration considerations

The new API endpoints behave very differently from their previous
counterparts. Simply updating the endpoint URLs will result in errors in
your application. Consider the following when updating your application
for the migration.

#### New Direct Message object

The first thing you are likely to notice is the new object structure of
Direct Messages. This new Message Create object structure has been
introduced to support new capabilities like [Quick
Replies](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/quick-replies)
and
[Attachments](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/message-attachments)
. The new object also contains a smaller condensed user object. Your
application will need to be updated to account for this new object
structure when parsing and potentially in data models or storage. For
descriptions of each property see the [full documentation on the Message
Create
Object](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/guides/message-create-object)
.\

**Example message create object**\

    {
      "type": "message_create",
      "id": "1234858592",
      "created_timestamp": "1392078023603",
      "initiated_via": {
        "tweet_id": "123456",
        "welcome_message_id": "456789"
      },
      "message_create": {
        "target": {
          "recipient_id": "1234858592"
        },
        "sender_id": "3805104374",
        "source_app_id": "268278",
        "message_data": {
          "text": "Blue Bird",
          "entities": {
            "hashtags": [],
            "symbols": [],
            "urls": [],
            "user_mentions": [],
          },
          "quick_reply_response": {
            "type": "options",
            "metadata": "external_id_2"
          },
          "attachment": {
            "type": "media",
            "media": {
             ...
            }
          }
        }
      }

#### Summary

-   Entirely new Direct Message object structure.
-   Condensed user object.
-   New information provided (quick reply responses, attachments, etc).

### []{#sending} Sending Direct Messages

[POST
direct_messages/events/new](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/new-event)
is a direct replacement for sending Direct Messages. The most
significant difference with this endpoint is that all information is now
sent as JSON in the POST request body as opposed to individual POST
params.

**Example Twurl request**\

    twurl -A 'Content-type: application/json' -X POST /1.1/direct_messages/events/new.json -d '{"event": {"type": "message_create", "message_create": {"target": {"recipient_id": "4534871"}, "message_data": {"text": "Hello World!"}}}}'

Note in the above request that the content-type is set to
application/json as opposed to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
Additionally, if you are constructing the OAuth 1.0a signature, note
that the JSON body is not included in the generation of the signature.
Most OAuth libraries already account for this. If you are using
[twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) , ensure you are using at
least version 0.9.3.\

#### Summary

-   Message is defined in JSON POST body
-   Content-type header must be set to application/json
-   JSON body is not included in the generation of the OAuth signature.\

### Retrieving Direct Messages []{#receiving}

Retrieving past Direct Message is now accomplished with a single API
endpoint: [GET
direct_messages/events/list](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/list-events)
. The significant difference with this new endpoint is that it now
returns both sent and received messages in reverse chronological order.
This may make it easier to rebuild a conversation. However, if you are
only looking for sent or received messages you will need to post-process
the response by referring to the sender_id property.

Pagination is now based on a cursor value rather an ID of a Direct
Message. A cursor property is returned with each response. [GET
direct_messages/events/list](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/list-events)
will return up to 30 days of past messages, regardless of how many
messages exist within the past 30 days. When a cursor is not returned,
there are no more messages to be returned. The method for accessing
individual Direct Messages with [GET
direct_messages/events/show](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/get-event)
remains the same, although the Direct Message object returned has a
different structure as described previously.

Finally, real-time access to Direct Messages will now be accomplished
via webhook with the [Account Activity
API](/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/overview)
. For guidance in migrating from User Streams or Site Streams, see the
migration guide to Account Activity API for more information.

#### Summary

-   Sent and Received messages are now returned on the same endpoint.
-   Up to 30 days of messages returned.
-   Cursor based pagination.
-   Real-time access to Direct Message via webhook.\

### Deleting Direct Messages []{#deleting}

Direct Messages can now be deleted with DELETE
direct_messages/events/destroy. The interface is largely the same
requiring the ID of the message to delete. The key differences is the
endpoint now requires a DELETE request instead of a POST request.

How deleted Direct Messages are reflected in official Twitter clients
remains the same. Direct Messages are only removed from the interface of
the user context provided. Other members of the conversation can still
access the Direct Message.

#### Summary

-   Deleting a Direct Message requires the ID.
-   New endpoint requires a DELETE request.
-   How deleted Direct Messages are reflected in official Twitter
    clients remains unchanged.
