**` GET /{ig-media-id} `**

Gets [fields](#fields) and [edges](#edges) on IG media.

### Limitations

-   Fields that return aggregated values don\'t include ads-driven data.
    For example, ` comments_count ` counts comments on a photo, but not
    comments on ads that contain that photo.
-   Captions don\'t include the ` @ ` symbol unless the app user is also
    able to perform Admin-equivalent [tasks](/docs/pages/overview#tasks)
    on the app.
-   Some fields, such as ` permalink ` , cannot be used on photos within
    albums (children).
-   Instagram TV media must be shared to Instagram at the time of
    publish ( **Post a Preview** or **Share Preview to Feed** enabled)
    in order to be accessible via the API.
-   Live video IG Media can only be read while they are being broadcast.
