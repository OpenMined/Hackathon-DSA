The Researcher API was specifically designed for academic needs. It
equips qualified academics to conduct longitudinal research across all
public Facebook Pages, Groups, Posts and Events in the US and select EU
countries. Researchers can use this product to understand how public
discussions on Facebook influence the social issues of the day. We offer
this product via the Researcher Platform, which allows us to share
privacy-protected data in a secure way.

We have invited a small group of qualified academics to test this
product and provide feedback so we can iterate and improve it, before
launching to a broader group of researchers.
