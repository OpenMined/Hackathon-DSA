This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the
Bookmarks lookup endpoint using
[Postman](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman)
. \

Please visit our [Twitter API v2 sample
code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub
repository if you want to see sample code in different languages.

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and
tokens](/en/docs/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can
generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

-   [Sign up for a developer account](/en/apply-for-access) and receive
    approval.
-   Create a [Project](/en/docs/projects) and an associated [developer
    App](/en/docs/apps) in the developer portal.
-   Navigate to your App\'s "Keys and tokens" page to generate the
    required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure
    location.

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you
can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we will use the Postman
tool here to simplify the process.

To load the Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment,
please click on the following button:

Once you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate
to the "Bookmarks" folder, and select " Bookmarks lookup".

### Step two: Authenticate your request

To make a successful request to this endpoint, you will need to use
[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with
PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)
. You can generate an access token within Postman.

If you go to the tab entitled "Authorization" and select "OAuth 2.0".

In this tab, be sure to follow these steps:

1.  Name your token

2.  Select the Grant Type as Authorization Code (with PKCE)

3.  Update the parameters:

    **Callback URL** -
    [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)

    This should be matching the callback URL you set in your auth
    settings page in the Developer Portal.

    **Auth URL** - <https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize>

    **Access Token URL** - <https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token>

    **Client ID** - Cut and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the Developer
    Portal

    **Client Secret** -¬†Cut and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the
    Developer Portal. You will need this only if you are using an App
    type that is a confidential client.

4.  Update the scopes with the following values: tweet.read users.read
    bookmark.read

5.  Populate the field state with "State"

6.  Click where it says "Generate Token"

7.  Press the save icon to save the folder changes.

You may get a message that you are not logged into Twitter. If you get
this error, you will need to log in to the Twitter account inside of
Postman you are trying to post on behalf of.

#### Step three: Specify a user

With this endpoint, you must specify the user ID whose followers you
would like to receive in the response. For example, the user ID for
\@TwitterDev is [ 2244994945 ]{.code-inline} . In Postman, navigate to
the "Params" tab and enter the ID of yourself or an authenticated user
as the value for the id parameter.

#### Step four: Make your request and review your response

Once you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will
receive a similar response to the following example response:

::: {.b19-code-snippet .twtr-component-space--md}
::: {.b19-snippet .b19__theme--light}
::: t05-inline-code-snippet
