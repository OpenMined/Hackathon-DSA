Please click to the left to expand this list and see more information on each parameter. See also the Google Photo Sphere spec for more info on the meaning of the params: https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata
 |
| `ProjectionType`string | Accepted values include equirectangular (full spherical photo),
 cylindrical (panorama), and cubestrip (also known as cubemap, e.g.
 for synthetic or rendered content; stacked vertically with 6 faces).
Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels`int64 | --- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to equirectangular.
 This value should be equal to the actual width of the image, and
 together with FullPanoWidthPixels, it describes the horizontal FOV
 of content of the image: HorizontalFOV = 360 \*
 CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / FullPanoWidthPixels.
--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel
 dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the
 horizontal FOV of the content of the image.
 HorizontalFOV = CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels / PixelsPerDegree,
 where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.
Required |
| `CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels`int64 | --- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: This value will NOT be equal to
 the actual height of the image. Instead, together with
 FullPanoHeightPixels, it describes the vertical FOV of the image:
 VerticalFOV = 180 \* CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels /
 FullPanoHeightPixels. In other words, this value is equal to the
 CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it
 were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the
 same FullPanoWidthPixels.
--- In cubestrip projection: This has no relationship to the pixel
 dimensions of the image. It is simply a representation of the
 vertical FOV of the content of the image.
 VerticalFOV = CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels / PixelsPerDegree,
 where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.
Required |
| `FullPanoWidthPixels`int64 | --- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: Very similar to
 equirectangular. This value defines a ratio of horizontal pixels to
 degrees in the space of the image, and in general the pixel to degree
 ratio in the scope of the metadata object. Concretely, PixelsPerDegree =
 FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. This is also equivalent to the
 circumference of the cylinder used to model this projection.
--- In cubestrip projection: This value has
 no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It only defines
 the pixel to degree ratio in the scope of the metadata object. It
 represents the number of pixels in 360 degrees, so pixels per degree
 is then given by: PixelsPerDegree = FullPanoWidthPixels / 360. As an
 example, if FullPanoWidthPixels were chosen to be 3600, we would have
 PixelsPerDegree = 3600 / 360 = 10. An image with a vertical field of
 view of 65 degrees would then have a CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels value
 of 65 \* 10 = 650.
Required |
| `FullPanoHeightPixels`int64 | --- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal
 to the FullPanoHeightPixels value that this image would have, if it
 were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the
 same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is always equal to
 FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.
--- In cubestrip projection: This value has
 no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is a second,
 redundant representation of PixelsPerDegree.
 FullPanoHeightPixels = 180 \* PixelsPerDegree. It must be consistent
 with FullPanoWidthPixels:
 FullPanoHeightPixels = FullPanoWidthPixels / 2.
Required |
| `CroppedAreaLeftPixels`int64 | Default value: `0`--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal
 to the CroppedAreaLeftPixels value that this image would have, if it
 were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the
 same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same
 angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the
 Google Photo Sphere spec.
 Concretely, AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels /
 PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by
 FullPanoWidthPixels.
--- In cubestrip projection: This value has
 no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is just a
 representation of the same angular offset that it represents in
 equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec.
 AngularOffsetFromLeftDegrees = CroppedAreaLeftPixels / PixelsPerDegree,
 where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.
 |
| `CroppedAreaTopPixels`int64 | Default value: `0`--- In equirectangular projection: As described in Google Photo Sphere
 XMP Metadata spec.
--- In cylindrical projection: This value is equal
 to the CroppedAreaTopPixels value that this image would have, if it
 were projected into equirectangular format while maintaining the
 same FullPanoWidthPixels. It is just a representation of the same
 angular offset that it represents in equirectangular projection in the
 Google Photo Sphere spec.
 Concretely, AngularOffsetFromTopDegrees = CroppedAreaTopPixels /
 PixelsPerDegree, where PixelsPerDegree is defined by
 FullPanoWidthPixels.
--- In cubestrip projection: This value has
 no relationship to the pixel dimensions of the image. It is just a
 representation of the same angular offset that it represents in
 equirectangular projection in the Google Photo Sphere spec.
 AngularOffsetFromTopDegrees = CroppedAreaTopPixels / PixelsPerDegree,
 where PixelsPerDegree is defined by FullPanoWidthPixels.
