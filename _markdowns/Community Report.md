 Community Report
=================


   
 This report covers actions we took on content that violated our Professional Community Policies and User Agreement for the six-month period between January 1 and June 30, 2023. It also summarizes requests to remove content based on copyright infringement claims.  
 









































 This report covers:
--------------------









Fake accounts

 Spam and scams

 Content violations

 Copyrighted materials

























































 Fake accounts
--------------


   
 We are a safe, trusted and professional community where real people share, learn and connect. Our policies prohibit fake profiles and require that members are real people who represent themselves accurately and contribute authentically.   
 




















###  What we do to catch fake accounts


   
 Our automated defenses blocked 90.1% of the fake accounts we stopped during the January - June 2023 period, with the remaining 9.9% stopped by our manual investigations and restrictions. 99.7% of the fake accounts were stopped proactively, before a member report. We continue enhancing our defenses to prevent and remove malicious accounts.

 Spam and scams
---------------


   
 Spam and scams are not permitted on LinkedIn. By far the most common type of inappropriate content we take action on is spam or scam content, which includes inappropriate commercial activity and repetitive communications or invitations, often meant for financial gain. 




















###  What we do to catch spam and scams


   
 Of the spam or scam content removed in this reporting period, our automated defenses stopped 99.6% and our teams manually removed the rest.

 Content violations
-------------------


   
 We do not tolerate any content that violates our Professional Community Policies, and take swift action to remove it. We won’t always get it right, so members can ask us to take a second look.  
   
 Similar to our previous reporting periods, we continue to see record-high engagement and conversations from our growing community of over 950 million members. While we saw an overall decrease in violative content across most categories compared to the previous reporting period, we did see an increase in caught harassing and abusive content, attributable to enhanced messaging defenses.
