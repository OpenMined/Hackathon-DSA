We do not tolerate any content that violates our [Professional Community
Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies)
, and take swift action to remove it. We won't always get it right, so
members can [ask us to take a second
look](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/82934) .

Similar to our previous reporting periods, we continue to see
record-high engagement and conversations from our growing community of
over 950 million members.Â While we saw an overall decrease in violative
content across most categories compared to the previous reporting
period, we did see an increase in caught harassing and abusive content,
attributable to enhanced messaging defenses.
