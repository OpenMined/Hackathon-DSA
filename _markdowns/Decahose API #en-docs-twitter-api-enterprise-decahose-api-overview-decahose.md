The Decahose delivers a 10% random sample of the realtime Twitter Firehose through a streaming connection. This is accomplished via a realtime sampling algorithm which randomly selects the data, while still allowing for the expected low-latency delivery of data as it is sent through the firehose by Twitter.


Below are some of the features available with Decahose:


* **Expanded and enhanced URLs:** - fully unwinds shortened URLs and provides additional metadata (page title and description)
* **Stream partitioning** - 2 partitions, each containing 50% of volume of the Decahose stream
* **Enhanced reliability** - geographic diversity of backend systems


Note: This data is delivered in bulk, and does not support additional filtering (e.g. for keywords).
