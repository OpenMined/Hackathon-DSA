The Decahose delivers a 10% random sample of the realtime Twitter
Firehose through a streaming connection. This is accomplished via a
realtime sampling algorithm which randomly selects the data, while still
allowing for the expected low-latency delivery of data as it is sent
through the firehose by Twitter.

Below are some of the features available with Decahose:

-   **Expanded and enhanced URLs:** - fully unwinds shortened URLs and
    provides additional metadata (page title and description)
-   **Stream partitioning** - 2 partitions, each containing 50% of
    volume of the Decahose stream
-   **Enhanced reliability** - geographic diversity of backend systems

Note: This data is delivered in bulk, and does not support additional
filtering (e.g. for keywords).
