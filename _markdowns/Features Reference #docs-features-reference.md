Features Reference
==================


Features are authorization mechanisms that allow apps to access specific types of data through our various APIs. In this way they are similar to Permissions, however Features cannot be granted to an app by an app user. Instead, Features are active or inactive depending on the app user's relationship to the app and the app's mode when it is being used.


For apps in Development Mode, all Features except for Page Public Content Access and Page Public Metadata Access are active for any app user who has a Role on the app or a Role in a Business that has claimed the app.


For apps in Live Mode, only Features approved through App Review are active for app users. This also applies to app users who have a Role on the app or Business.


For Business app types (which have access levels instead of modes), Features are active for any app users who have a Role on the app or in a Business that has claimed the app, unless access has been removed. In order for a Feature to be active for app users without a Role on the app or Business, it must first be approved through App Review.


Access to any Feature that is granted by default or through App Review can be used to request analytics insights to improve your app and for marketing or advertising purposes, through the use of aggregated and de-identified or anonymized information (provided such data cannot be re-identified).


Unlike Permissions, Features do not expire, their approval will not be revoked, if they are unused.
