Updates the authenticating user\'s current status, also known as
Tweeting.

For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the
authenticating user\'s recent Tweets. Any attempt that would result in
duplication will be blocked, resulting in a 403 error. A user cannot
submit the same status twice in a row.

While not rate limited by the API, a user is limited in the number of
Tweets they can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the
user reaches the current allowed limit this method will return an HTTP
403 error.

**About Geo**

-   Any geo-tagging parameters in the update will be ignored if
    ` geo_enabled ` for the user is false (this is the default setting
    for all users, unless the user has enabled geolocation in their
    settings)
-   The number of digits after the decimal separator passed to ` lat `
    (up to 8) is tracked so that when the ` lat ` is returned in a
    status object it will have the same number of digits after the
    decimal separator.
-   Use a decimal point as the separator (and not a decimal comma) for
    the latitude and the longitude - usage of a decimal comma will cause
    the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped.
-   For JSON, the response mostly uses conventions described in
    [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) . However, the ` geo ` object
    coordinates that Twitter renders are **reversed** from the GeoJSON
    specification. GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude,
    whereas Twitter represents it as a latitude then a longitude:
    ` "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78217, -122.40062] } `
-   The ` coordinates ` object is replacing the ` geo ` object (no
    deprecation date has been set for the ` geo ` object yet) \-- the
    difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered
    correctly in GeoJSON.
-   If a ` place_id ` is passed into the status update, then that place
    will be attached to the status. If no ` place_id ` was explicitly
    provided, but ` latitude ` and ` longitude ` are, the API attempts
    to implicitly provide a place by calling
    [geo/reverse_geocode](/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-reverse_geocode)
    .
-   Users have the ability to remove all geotags from all their Tweets
    en masse via the user settings page. Currently there is no method to
    remove geotags from individual Tweets.

## Resource URL [Â¶](#resource-url){.headerlink}

` https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json `

  -------------------------- -------------------------------
  Response formats           JSON
  Requires authentication?   Yes (user context only)
  Rate limited?              Yes
  Requests / 3-hour window   300\* per user; 300\* per app
  -------------------------- -------------------------------

*Please note* - The 300 per 3 hours is a combined limit with the [POST
statuses/retweet/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-retweet-id)
endpoint. You can only post 300 Tweets or Retweets during a 3 hour
period.

## Example Request [Â¶](#example-request){.headerlink}

To obtain the generated oauth_nonce, oauth_token, and oauth_signature
you can use a REST tool such as Insomnia or Postman.

    curl -XPOST 
      --url 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json?status=hello' 
      --header 'authorization: OAuth
      oauth_consumer_key="oauth_customer_key",
      oauth_nonce="generated_oauth_nonce",
      oauth_signature="generated_oauth_signature",
      oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
      oauth_timestamp="generated_timestamp",
      oauth_token="oauth_token",
      oauth_version="1.0"'

You many want to change the status from \'hello\' to something
different.

You can use also use any other OAuth helper library you\'d like such as
twurl.

    $ twurl -d 'status=Test tweet using the POST statuses/update endpoint' /1.1/statuses/update.json

## Example Response [Â¶](#example-response){.headerlink}

After you post successfully you should get back something that looks
like this:
