Introduction
------------


List Tweets lookup has one available endpoint to retrieve Tweets from a specified List. With this endpoint, you can build solutions that enable users to customize, organize and prioritize the Tweets they see in their timeline.  




There is a rate limit of 900 requests per 15 minutes for this endpoint and the response will support querying the latest 800 Tweets for a given List.


You can use OAuth 1.0a User Context, App only, or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE to authenticate your requests to this endpoint. 











**Account setup**


To access these endpoints, you will need:


* An approved developer account.
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a developer App that is located within a Project.
