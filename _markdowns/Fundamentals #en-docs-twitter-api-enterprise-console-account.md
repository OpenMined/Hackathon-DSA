Please note that there are three types of users -- Account Admin, User,
and Email Only.

-   Account admins are allowed to create/delete/edit other users, and
    can use basic authentication with username (email) and password to
    connect to the enterprise APIs

-   Users cannot create or modify other users, but can use basic
    authentication with username (email) and password to connect to the
    enterprise APIs

-   Email Only users do not have access to the dashboard, are not
    authorized to connect to the enterprise APIs  and only receive
    notifications, if they are configured to receive them in the
    Notifications section.

Configure volume thresholds for your products. These will initiate email
alerts for the users who have configured those notifications in their
profiles, both for the warning threshold and critical threshold for each
product.
