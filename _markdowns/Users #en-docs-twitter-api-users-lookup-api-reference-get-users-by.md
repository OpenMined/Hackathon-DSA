### Query parameters



| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `usernames`¬†Required¬† | string | A comma separated list of Twitter usernames (handles). Up to 100 are allowed in a single request. Make sure to not include a space between commas and fields. |
| `expansions`¬†Optional¬† | enum (`pinned_tweet_id`) | Expansions enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned users. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the user data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the `includes` response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object. At this time, the only expansion available to endpoints that primarily return user objects is `expansions=pinned_tweet_id`. You will find the expanded Tweet data object living in the `includes` response object. |
| `tweet.fields`¬†Optional¬† | enum (`attachments`, `author_id`, `context_annotations`, `conversation_id`, `created_at`, `edit_controls`, `entities`, `geo`, `id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `lang`, `non_public_metrics`, `public_metrics`, `organic_metrics`, `promoted_metrics`, `possibly_sensitive`, `referenced_tweets`, `reply_settings`, `source`, `text`, `withheld`) | This fields parameter enables you to select which specific Tweet fields will deliver in each returned pinned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet fields will only return if the user has a pinned Tweet and if you've also included the `expansions=pinned_tweet_id` query parameter in your request. While the referenced Tweet ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional Tweet fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `user.fields`¬†Optional¬† | enum (`created_at`, `description`, `entities`, `id`, `location`, `most_recent_tweet_id`, `name`, `pinned_tweet_id`, `profile_image_url`, `protected`, `public_metrics`, `url`, `username`, `verified`, `verified_type`, `withheld`) | This fields parameter enables you to select which specific user fields will deliver with each returned users objects. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. These specified user fields will display directly in the user data objects. |
