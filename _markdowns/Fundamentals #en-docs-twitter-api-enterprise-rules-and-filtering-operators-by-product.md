<div>

Matches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a
particular language (if, and only if, the tweet has been classified).
Each Tweet will be classified with only one language, so AND'ing
together multiple languages will yield no results.

**Note:** if no language classification can be made the provided result
is ` und ` (for undefined).

This operator will only match against supported languages. Providing any
other value (including ` und ` ) will result in the operator being
ignored (in other words, Tweets will not be filtered by this operator).
The list below represents the currently supported languages and their
corresponding BCP 47 language identifier:
