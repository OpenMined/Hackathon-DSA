Important resources



Learn about what's possible
---------------------------


Our use cases, solutions, and product pages that are accessible from the top navigation are a great way to get a high-level overview of what’s possible on the platform. 


We have also built out several tutorials that help you identify how to use one or many different platform tools to satisfy a variety of different use cases. 


At the lowest-level of our documentation lives our endpoint and tool docs, which all include introductory content that provides a brief overview of that tool’s functionality and typical use case. For example, here is our Twitter API v2 endpoint section for Search Tweets.  

 


### Integrate an endpoint into your system


To make your integration with our endpoints seamless, we have built out a set of tools, libraries, and integration guides. The easiest way to integrate is to use our tools and libraries, which automatically handle complex functionality such as OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication, pagination, and rate limit handling. 


If you would rather build a solution from the ground up, our endpoint integration guides describe the functionality and best practices around integrating our endpoints into your system. These guides can be found in the different endpoint and tool documentation, listed as ‘integrate’ or simply ‘guides’. For example, here is an integration guide on how to build a rule for the Filter stream.  

 


### Troubleshoot an issue


If you are running into an error or have a question, please check out our support hub. There, you will find troubleshooting tips, answers to frequently asked questions and other useful resources.   

 


### Keep up-to-date with the latest releases


We frequently release updates to the platform to unlock new Twitter functionality via the API. In addition to this, we aim to release at least one new major version bump per year, which will include some breaking changes. 


To receive the latest updates, please make sure to subscribe to our forum’s Announcements category, follow @TwitterAPI and @TwitterDev on Twitter and turn on notifications, and review our different resources via our stay informed page. 


In addition to this, we have built out a new migration hub to help guide you through the process of updating to the latest version of the API.
