Apps using the hide replies endpoint
------------------------------------


Here's a collection of noteworthy apps built by developers who integrated the hide replies endpoint. By matching their technology with the Twitter API, they created useful experiences to help all users enhance the public conversation.













Clarabridge
-----------



Clarabridge integrates hide replies so that companies can keep their Twitter feed clean and interesting to read. Replies can be hidden manually, and agents can also use Clarabridge’s text analytics to automatically detect profanity and other language that is not in line with brand policy.

Perspective API template app
----------------------------



Perspective is an artificial intelligence trained by Jigsaw (a unit within Alphabet) to detect toxic comments. This app detects a person's incoming replies, and automatically hides a reply based on the “score” that indicates how confident Perspective is that a comment is similar to toxic comments it’s seen in the past. This is an open source template app developed by Twitter. We encourage you to personalize it to build tools for your users.
