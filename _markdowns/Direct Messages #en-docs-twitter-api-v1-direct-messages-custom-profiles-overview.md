Custom profiles allow a Direct Message author to present a different
identity than that of the Twitter account being used. For example,
brands may want customer service agents posting under a single Twitter
account to use their own name and photo. A custom profile may also be
used to attach a unique identity to a message authored by an automated
application or bot so that users clearly understand they are talking to
a bot.

## To use the custom profiles feature:

1.  Posting accounts must be Verified and on an allowlist to use this
    feature.
2.  Create a custom profile with a name and photo using the API.
3.  Attach a custom profile ID to new Direct Message POST requests.
    Valid custom profiles will override the default avatar.
