We encourage you to build tools and products that make Twitter better, healthier, and extend the public conversation. In particular, we want to see innovation in the following categories:  \n* [Moderate conversations for health and safety](#moderate)\n* [Enable creation and personal expression](#enable)\n* [Measure and analyze what\u2019s happening](#measure)\n* [Improve community experiences](#improve)\n* [Curate and recommend content](#curate)\n* [Impact the greater good](#impact)\n",

We\u2019ve worked hard to offer tools that give people more control over their experience, like Tweet reply settings, blocks, and mutes. However, there will always be more work to do, and we want to encourage you to build complementary or additive solutions that help improve the health and safety of the platform.

It\u2019s the convergence of individuals and brands, founders and athletes, celebrities and CEOs. Developers have an opportunity to build creative solutions that allow people on Twitter to expand their reach, express themselves in new ways, and connect with like minded communities. As creators and innovators themselves, developers can also build things that broaden how people experience Twitter like helpful bots, gamification, or cross-posted content. Below are a few ideas to seed your innovation:  \nRelevant endpoints:  \n* [Manage Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/introduction)\n* [Spaces](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/spaces/overview)\n* [Retweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/retweets/introduction)  \nSample apps:  \n* [Spaces Reach](https://github.com/twitterdev/spaces-reach)\n* [FactualCat Twitter bot](https://github.com/twitterdev/FactualCat-Twitter-Bot/)\n",

Developers can help these creators, artists, businesses, and local advocates measure, analyze, or understand the impact of their content. Additionally, developers can build new solutions that help people derive insights from the public conversation about trends, their audience, and so much more.
