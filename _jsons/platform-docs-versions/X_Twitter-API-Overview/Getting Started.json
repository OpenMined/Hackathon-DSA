For example, a Tweet is a resource that you can create, delete, or retrieve using a variety of different tools, such as historically searching for them, or retrieving them in real-time.  \nThe Twitter API provides access to create, delete, receive, or adjust a variety of different resources on the platform including the following:  \n| Resource | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Tweets** | Tap into millions of Tweets to understand the public conversation, or create your own to engage with the conversation.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Twitter API v2<br>* Enterprise<br>* Premium v1.1<br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Users** | Manage or look up Twitter users to analyze networks, understand your audience, or foster positive online relationships.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Twitter API v2<br>* Enterprise<br>* Premium v1.1<br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Spaces** | Look up and search Twitter Spaces and their attendees to help people find interesting and relevant audio conversations.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Twitter API v2 |\n| **Direct Messages** | Send and receive Direct Messages to triage customer issues, send welcome messages, or create positive human interaction.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Lists** | Curate and manage lists of accounts to keep a pulse on industry experts, powerful voices, or organize who you follow.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Twitter API v2<br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Trends** | Identify geographic trends first to pinpoint industry movement, discover hot topics, or stay ahead of the latest fad.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Media** | Upload media objects to share your creative energy, create interactive experiences, or build accessibility tools.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Standard v1.1 |\n| **Places** | Search for places to understand what\u2019s happening in your neighborhood and around the world.<br><br>Current availability:<br><br>* Standard v1.1 |\n",

The ones that you can generate via the developer portal represent the user that owns the App. You will use these to authenticate requests that require [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a). If you would like to make requests on behalf of another user, you will need to use the 3-legged OAuth flow for them to authorize you.  \n* **[Client ID and Client Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/content/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token):** These credentials are used to obtain a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0 authentication. Similar to OAuth 1.0a, the user Access Tokens are used to authenticate requests that provide private user account information or perform actions on behalf of another account but, with fine-grained scope for greater control over what access the client application has on the user.  \n* **[App only Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens):** You will use this token when making requests to endpoints that responds with information\u00a0publicly available on Twitter.  \nSince these keys and tokens do not expire unless regenerated, we suggest that you save them in a secure location, such as a password manager, once you've received your credentials.  \n**Please note: Your keys and tokens will only display once in the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal), so it is important that you store these credentials in your password management system as soon as you generate them.**  \nIf you misplace or forget the keys and tokens, you will need to regenerate them, which creates new credentials and invalidates the old ones. This means that you will have to update any integrations that you may have set up with your prior credentials.  \nLearn more about our [authentication best practices](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/authentication-best-practices).  \n###  \nStep three: Make your first request  \nWhat\u2019s next? Let\u2019s make your first request to the API!  \nWe have guides, tutorials, tools, and code to help you get started.

Choose a tool to make your request\n\nContent: \n### Step 2. Choose a tool to make your request  \nWhile some requests can be straightforward, others can be tricky to build. That\u2019s why the amazing community of developers have developed tools to abstract away some of the complexity.  \nThe following are some recommended tools and details on how to use them:  \n#### Postman  \nPostman is a visual tool that you can use to make requests to REST endpoints. We\u2019ve created some great materials around Postman to help you get started with and explore the different endpoints available via the Twitter API.  \nWe recommend you read through our [\"Getting started with Postman\" tutorial](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started) to learn how to add your keys and tokens and make your first request.  \nWe\u2019ve also produced a quick start guide for each of our Twitter API v2 endpoints, most of which use Postman. You can find these guides in each respective endpoint section, but here is a link to a few:  \n* Quick start: Post a Tweet\n* Quick start: Search for Tweets\n* Quick start: Lookup a user  \nPlease note that you can\u2019t make requests to streaming endpoints using Postman. Please visit the [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/quick-start) or [1% ampled stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/volume-streams/quick-start/sampled-stream) quick start guide to learn how to work with those endpoints.  \nIf you prefer a more simple graphical tool, you should also consider using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).  \n#### Sample code  \nIf you are interested in using some simple code to make your request, we\u2019ve put together sample code in multiple different languages for each of our Twitter API v2 endpoints.  \nYou can find the code samples via our Github repo, [Twitter-API-v2-sample-code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code), which also contains a README file that you can use to learn how to set up your credentials to properly work with the requests.  \nFor example, here is a cURL example for the user lookup endpoint. All you have to do to use this request is replace the $ACCESS\\_TOKEN and $USERNAME with your [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) and Twitter handle. Then, copy and paste this code into your command line tool and press \u2018Return\u2019 or \u2018Enter\u2019.  \n`curl \"https://api.twitter.com/2/users/by/username/$USERNAME\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\"`  \n#### Libraries  \nThe amazing TwitterDev community has also built libraries in a variety of different coding languages that can be used to make requests to the Twitter API.  \nWe\u2019ve built out a [\"Tools and libraries\" page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) that lists all of the community libraries that we are aware of. Each library should have a ReadMe file that can be used to learn how to set up the repo on your machine and make your first request.  \n**Please note:** If you run into any problems, please read through our developer docs for the endpoint that you are making a request to, our [support section](https://developer.twitter.com/en/support), or reach out to the community on our forums for help. We\u2019ll get you to a successful request!\n",

For example, you can request additional metadata fields when using GET endpoints with the fields and expansions parameters. You can also experiment with a variety of different filtering tools with endpoints such as [search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search), [Tweet counts](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts), and [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream) to help narrow down the data you receive to just those Tweets that you are interested in.  \nYou can find a full list of the request parameters and fields in the API Reference for the endpoint that you are working with, and a host of other helpful integration information in our integration guides and fundamentals pages.  \nYou can learn more about all of the educational materials we\u2019ve made available to you via our [Important resources](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/important-resources) guide.\n",
