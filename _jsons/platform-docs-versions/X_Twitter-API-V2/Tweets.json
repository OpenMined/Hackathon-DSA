In its simplest form, a Tweet can contain up to 280 characters and can be posted either publicly or privately, depending on an account\u2019s settings. However, a variety of different objects can also be attached to Tweet, including media, a place, polls, and URLs.\u00a0In addition, most Tweets can be edited for up to 30 minutes after being created.  \nWhile there are a variety of different HTTP, selection, and delivery methods that can deliver, publish, and act upon Tweets, this group of REST endpoints simply returns a Tweet or group of Tweets, specified by a [Tweet ID](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-ids). While simple, these endpoints can be used to receive up-to-date details on a Tweet, verify that a Tweet is available, and examine its edit history. These endpoints are also important tools for managing\u00a0[compliance events](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/compliance-firehose-api/overview).  \nThe Tweet lookup endpoint provides edited Tweet metadata. All objects for Tweets created since September 29, 2022, include Tweet edit metadata, even if the Tweet was never edited. Each time a Tweet is edited, a new Tweet ID is created. A Tweet's edit history is documented by an array of Tweet IDs, starting with the original ID.  \nThis endpoint will always return the most recent edit, along with any edit history. Any Tweet collected after its 30-minute edit window has expired will represent its final version. To learn more about Edit Tweet metadata, check out the\u00a0[Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets)\u00a0page.  \nThese endpoints utilize the GET HTTP method and return one or many [Tweet objects](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet),\u00a0which include fields such as the Tweet text, a timestamp from when it was created, and lists and metadata of hashtags, mentions, and photos, and more.  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=/2/tweets&method=get)\n",

To do this with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0authentication methods.  \nFor simplicity's sake, we are going to utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but if you'd like to request private [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics) or Tweets, you will need to use one of the other authentication methods.  \nTo utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens (and specifically the\u00a0[App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens), also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d (in the top-right corner of Postman), and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nIf you've done this correctly, these variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab.  \n#### Step three: Identify and specify which Tweets you would like to retrieve  \nYou must specify a Tweet or a set of Tweets that you would like to receive within the request. You can find the Tweet ID by navigating to twitter.com and clicking on a Tweet and then looking in the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is `1228393702244134912`.  \n`https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1228393702244134912`  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Tweet IDs separated by a comma, into the \"Value\" column of the `ids` parameter.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `ids` | `1228393702244134912,``1227640996038684673,``1199786642791452673` |  \n#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet)\u00a0object fields in your response: id, text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond id\u00a0,\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a three additional different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.  \n2. The associated authors\u2019 user object\u2019s default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username\n3. The additional\u00a0 user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |\n| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets?ids=1228393702244134912,1227640996038684673,1199786642791452673&tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at`  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2020-02-14T19:00:55.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1228393702244134912\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1228393702244134912\"],       \"text\": \"What did the developer write in their Valentine\u2019s card?\\n  \\nwhile(true) {\\n    I = Love(You);  \\n}\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2020-02-12T17:09:56.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1227640996038684673\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1227640996038684673\"],       \"text\": \"Doctors: Googling stuff online does not make you a doctor\\n\\nDevelopers: https://t.co/mrju5ypPkb\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2019-11-27T20:26:41.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1199786642791452673\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1199786642791452673\"],       \"text\": \"C#\"     }   ],   \"includes\": {     \"users\": [       {         \"created_at\": \"2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z\",         \"id\": \"2244994945\",         \"name\": \"Twitter Dev\",         \"username\": \"TwitterDev\"       }     ]   } }`\n",

Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our\u00a0[getting started with Postman guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman).  \nCode samples  \nInterested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We\u2019ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our\u00a0[Github page.](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Third-party libraries](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \nTake advantage of one of our communities\u2019\u00a0[third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries)\u00a0to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/integrate\n\tIntegration guide\n\tKey concepts\n\nContent: \n### Key concepts  \n#### Authentication  \nAll Twitter API v2 endpoints require you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens.\u00a0You can use either OAuth 1.0a User Context, OAuth 2.0 App-Only, or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE to authenticate your requests to these endpoints.  \n[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0requires you to utilize your\u00a0API Keys, user Access Tokens, and a handful of other parameters to [create an authorization header](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request), which you will then pass with your request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize your App using the\u00a0[3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth 1.0a can be difficult to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a\u00a0[library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), use\u00a0a tool like Postman, or use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate your requests. If you would like to request a Tweet or private metrics from these endpoints, you will need to use a either OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE, which will ensure that you have the proper permissions from the user that owns that content.  \n[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) just requires that you pass an [OAuth 2.0 App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) with your request. You can either generate an App Access Token from directly within a developer App, or generate one using the [POST oauth2/token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference/token) endpoint.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)\u00a0allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user.  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your\u2019s App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.  \n**Please note**  \nIf you are requesting the following fields, OAuth 1.0a User Context or\u00a0OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code is required:  \n* tweet.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.organic\\_metrics\n* media.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* media.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* media.fields.organic\\_metrics  \n#### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must have an approved [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App.  \nRate limits  \nEveryday, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API, and in order to manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint. Rate limits number the requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThis endpoint is rate limited at both the App-level and the user-level. The app rate limit means that you, the developer, can only make a certain number of requests to this endpoint over a given period of time from any given App (assumed by using either the API Key and API Secret Key, or the App Access Token). The user rate limit means that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only perform a Tweets lookup a certain number of times across any developer App.  \nFields and expansions  \nThe Twitter API v2 allows users to select exactly which data they want to return from the API using a set of tools called fields and expansions. The expansion parameter allows you to expand objects referenced in the payload. For example, this endpoint allows you to pull the following [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions):  \n* edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids\n* attachments.poll\\_ids\n* attachments.media\\_keys\n* author\\_id\n* entities.mentions.username\n* geo.place\\_id\n* in\\_reply\\_to\\_user\\_id\n* referenced\\_tweets.id\n* referenced\\_tweets.id.author\\_id  \nThe fields parameter allows you to select exactly which [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) within the different data objects you would like to receive. These endpoints deliver Tweet objects primarily. By default, the Tweet object returns the\u00a0id,\u00a0\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids fields. To receive additional fields such as tweet.created\\_at or tweet.entities, you will have to specifically request those using a fields parameter. When you include edit\\_controls, you will receive information about whether the Tweet was ever eligible for edits, a timestamp indicating whether the 30-minute edit period has ended, and how many edit opportunities remain. Other important fields that you may want to consider using in your integration are our poll data, metrics, Tweet annotations, and conversation ID fields.  \nWe\u2019ve added a guide on how to [use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions)\u00a0in our [Twitter API v2 data dictionary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \n#### Tweet edits  \nTweets that are eligible for edits can be edited up to five times in the 30 minutes after the original Tweet was published. The Tweet lookup endpoint will always provide the latest version of the Tweet. If you only request Tweets that were published 30 or more minutes ago, you will always receive the final version of the Tweet. However, if you have a near-real-time use case, and are querying Tweets published within the last thirty minutes, those Tweets could have been edited after you received them. To learn more about how Tweet edits work, see the [Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) page.  \n#### Edge cases  \n* Requesting promoted metrics for Tweets that were not promoted returns an empty response, instead of Tweet data. Our team is currently working on fixing this issue.\n* Tweet text is truncated for Retweets. The short-term workaround is to expand the referenced Tweet and retrieve the full text from the expansion. This is a bug that we will fix in the future.\n",

Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 Tweet lookup endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the Twitter API v2 version.  \nDepending on your authentication library/package of choice, App-Only authentication is probably the easiest way to get started and can be set with a simple request header. To learn how to generate an App Access Token, see\u00a0[this OAuth 2.0 App-only guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only).  \n#### Tweets per request limits  \nThe v1.1\u00a0[GET statuses/lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/get-statuses-lookup)\u00a0endpoint allows you to specify 100 Tweets per request. This also goes for the GET /tweets endpoint. To specify a full 100 Tweets, you will need to pass the ids parameter as a query parameter rather than a path parameter and include the list of [Tweet IDs](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-ids) in a comma-separated list.  \n**Support for Tweet edit history and metadata**  \nBoth versions provide metadata that describes any edit history. Check out the [Tweet lookup API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/api-reference) and the [Edit Tweets fundamentals page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) for more details.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet id and text fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you will need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in Twitter API v2:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard** | **Twitter API v2** |\n| id  | ids |  \nThere are also a set of standard v1.1 Tweet lookup request parameters **not**\u00a0supported in Twitter API v2:  \n| Standard | Comment |\n| --- | --- |\n| tweet\\_mode | This parameter enables developers to request a series of different extended fields that had been introduced in the years since statuses/show and statuses/lookup were introduced. It has been replaced with the fields and expansions functionality. |\n| trim\\_user | This parameter is used to reduce the number of fields that deliver in the user object that comes alongside each Tweet. It has been replaced with the additive fields and expansions functionality.  <br>To request user information alongside your requested Tweet, you will need to use a combination of the author\\_id expansion and the user.fields\u00a0parameter with a set of specified [user fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user). |\n| include\\_my\\_retweet | This parameter includes the ID of the source Tweet for those specified Tweets that were Retweeted by the authenticating user. |\n| include\\_entities | This parameter is used to remove the entities node from the Tweet payload. It has been replaced with the additive fields and expansions functionality. |\n| include\\_ext\\_alt\\_text | This parameter adds an additional ext\\_alt\\_text field in the media entity if that media has alt text attached to it. |\n| include\\_card\\_uri | This parameters adds a card\\_uri attribute when there is an ads card attached. |\n| map | This parameter would return the Tweet ID and nullified fields for unavailable Tweets.\u00a0<br><br>In v2, we return the Tweet ID and a detailed error message for unavailable Tweets. |\n",

The new manage Tweets endpoints allow you to do just that and much more.  \nWe have two available methods for manage Tweets, POST and DELETE. The POST method lets you post polls, quote Tweets, Tweet with reply settings, Tweet with geo, Tweet with media and tag users, and Tweet to Super Followers, in addition to other features. Likewise, the DELETE method allows you to delete a specific Tweet. For the POST method, you can pass in [the parameters](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/api-reference) you are looking for to enable you to further customize your request.  \nThe 'delete Tweet' method has been updated to support edited Tweets. When any Tweet in a chain of Tweet edits is deleted, all Tweets in that edit chain are also deleted. To learn more about Edit Tweet metadata, check out the\u00a0[Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets)\u00a0page.  \nThere is a user rate limit of 200 requests per 15 minutes for the POST method. The DELETE method has a rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes. Additionally, there is a limit of 300 requests per 3 hours, including Tweets created with either manage Tweets or manage Retweets.  \nSince you are making requests on behalf of a user with the manage Tweets endpoints, you must authenticate with either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), and use a user Access Tokens associated with a user that has authorized your App. To generate this user Access Token with OAuth 1.0a, you can use the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens). To generate a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0, you can use the\u00a0[Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=/2/tweets&method=post)\n",

To do this with the manage Tweets endpoints, you must authenticate your request using either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code).  \nIn this example, we are going to use OAuth 1.0a User Context.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens (and specifically your API Key, API Secret Key, OAuth 1.0a user Access Token, and OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d (in the top-right corner of Postman), and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nIf you've done this correctly, these variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify the text of the Tweet  \nWhen creating a new Tweet with this endpoint, text or media for the Tweet are the required body parameters.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \u201cBody\u201d tab and enter the text of the Tweet as the value for the `text` parameter. Additionally, if you wish to add parameters for items such as polls, replying to a Tweet ID, or adding reply settings you can also do so here. You can learn more about what\u2019s available in our [API reference guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/api-reference).  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Parameter type** |\n| `text` | Hello world! | body |  \n####\nStep four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button, and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:  \n`{   \"data\": {     \"id\": \"1445880548472328192\",     \"text\": \"Hello world!\"   } }`  \nIf the returned response object contains an `id` and the `text` of your Tweet, you have successfully created a Tweet.  \n#### Step five: Delete your Tweet  \nTo delete a Tweet, select the \u201cDelete a Tweet\u201d request also found in the \u201cManage Tweets\u201d folder of the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman. This endpoint requires the ID of the Tweet you wish to delete. Then, in the \u201cParams\u201d tab, enter the ID of the Tweet you wish to delete as the value for the `id`\u00a0column.  \nOn successful delete request, you will receive a response similar to the following example:  \n`{    \"data\": {        \"deleted\" : true    } }`\n",

Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our [\"Using Postman\"](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman) page.  \n#### Code samples  \nInterested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We\u2019ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).  \n#### Third-party libraries  \nTake advantage of one of our communities\u2019 [third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/integrate\n\tIntegration guide\n\tKey concepts\n\nContent: \n### Key concepts  \n#### Authentication  \nAll Twitter API v2 endpoints require you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens.  \nThese specific endpoints requires the use of [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth 1.0a can be difficult to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a\u00a0[library](https://developer.twitter.com/content/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), use\u00a0a tool like Postman, or use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate your requests.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)\u00a0allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user.  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your\u2019s App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.  \n#### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must have a\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThese endpoints are rate limited at the user level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only call the endpoint a certain number of times across any developer App. There is a user rate limit of 200 requests per 15 minutes for the POST method. The DELETE method has a rate limit of 50 requests for 15 minutes. Additionally, there is a limit of [300 requests per 3 hours](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/new-developer-requirements-to-protect-our-platform), including Tweets created with either manage Tweets or manage Retweets.  \n#### Source labels  \nYour App name and website URL will be shown as the [source label](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-tweet#source-labels) within metadata for any Tweets created programmatically by your application. If you change the use case of a Twitter App, be sure to update the use case in these settings in order to ensure you are in compliance with the [Developer Terms](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy).  \n#### Profile settings  \nYou can only add a location to Tweets if you have geo enabled in your profile settings. If you don\u2019t have geo enabled, you can still add a location parameter in your request body, but it won\u2019t get attached to your Tweet. The same is also true for tagging users in images.\u00a0If the user you\u2019re tagging doesn\u2019t have photo-tagging enabled, their names won\u2019t show up in the list of tagged users even though the Tweet is successfully created.  \n#### Adding media to a Tweet  \n#### Currently, isn\u2019t a way to fully upload media using v2 of the Twitter API currently. However, you attach previously uploaded media to a Tweet. You can use media IDs that have been already [uploaded using the v1 media endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload) or [Twitter Media Studio](https://media.twitter.com/en/articles/products/2018/media-studio). These media ids must be your own or that of an authenticated user.\n",

See below for more details.  \nThese three timelines endpoints support edited Tweets. These endpoints will always return the most recent edit, along with the edit history. Any Tweet collected after its 30-minute edit window will represent its final version. Edit metadata includes an array of IDs for all Tweets in its history. For Tweets with no edit history, this array will hold a single ID. For Tweets that have been edited, this array contains multiple IDs, arranged in ascending order reflecting the order of edits, with the most recent version in the last position of the array. To learn more about how Tweet edits work, see the [Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) page.\n",

This endpoint has a per-user rate limit of 180 requests per 15-minute window. This endpoint can return every Tweet created on a timeline over the last 7 days as well as the most recent 800 regardless of creation date.\n",

This endpoint gives you access to a single Twitter account's most recent Tweets, Retweets, replies, and Quote Tweets, similar to what may be seen on a user's profile timeline.  \nHere is a user timeline for @XDevelopers:  \n[Tweets by XDevelopers](https://twitter.com/XDevelopers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \nThe user Tweet timeline endpoint is a REST endpoint that receives a single path parameter to indicate the desired user (by user ID). The endpoint can return the 3,200 most recent Tweets, Retweets, replies, and Quote Tweets posted by the user.  \nTweets are delivered in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent. Results are [paginated](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination.html) up to 100 Tweets per page. Pagination tokens are provided for paging through large sets of Tweets. The Tweet IDs of the newest and the oldest Tweets included in the given page are also provided as metadata, which can also be used for polling timelines for recent Tweets. The user Tweet timeline also supports the ability to specify start\\_time and end\\_time parameters to receive Tweets that were created within a certain window of time.  \nThe user Tweet timeline endpoint supports [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters, and returns the [new JSON data format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \nTo successfully make a request to this endpoint, you will need to authorize your request with the [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) authentication methods. You must use OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE when requesting nonpublic metrics, promoted metrics or a protected user's timeline.  \nThe user Tweet timeline endpoint is designed to support two common usage patterns:  \n* \"Get a user\u2019s historical Tweets\": Requests made to user Tweet timeline in order to receive Tweets authored by the user of interest in chronological order over a specific recent timeframe. The timeframe can be set using the start\\_time and end\\_time and paginating through the full results.\u00a0 In some cases, a user\u2019s entire history of Tweets can be retrieved if the user has only authored up to 3,200 Tweets in their account. Tweets included will depend on the public availability and the authentication that is used for the requests.  \n* \"Polling for new Tweets\": Requests made to user Tweet timeline on a continual basis, to retrieve new Tweets authored by a specific user. The last Tweet ID received can be set as a parameter for any new requests since the last Tweet.\n",

This will also include replies to Tweets by the user requested. Retrieving a user's mentions allows you to build experiences such as quickly discovering who is replying to a users' Tweets, mentioning or to create engagement workflows with their Tweets programmatically. The endpoint allows you to request to a single user's most recent mentions and replies, similar to what may be seen in a user's [notifications for mentions](https://twitter.com/notifications/mentions) on Twitter.  \nThe user mention timeline is a REST endpoint that receives a single path parameter to indicate the desired user (by user ID). The endpoint can return the 800 most recent mentions for that user.  \nTweets are delivered in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent. Results are [paginated](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination.html) in up to 100 Tweets per page. Pagination tokens are provided for paging through large sets of Tweets. The Tweet IDs of the newest and the oldest Tweets included in the given page are also provided as metadata, which can also be used for polling timelines for recent Tweets, or for navigating through the timeline similar to the v1.1 [mentions\\_timeline](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-mentions_timeline) endpoint. The endpoint also supports the ability to specify start\\_time and end\\_time parameters to receive Tweets that were created within a certain window of time.  \nTo successfully make a request to this endpoint, you will need to authorize your request with the [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) authentication methods. You must use OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE when requesting non public metrics, promoted metrics or a protected user's timeline.  \nThe user mention timeline endpoint supports [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters, and returns the [new JSON data format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/timelines/quick-start.html)  \n[Jump to example requests](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=%2F2%2Fusers%2F%7Bid%7D%2Ftweets&method=get)\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication methods.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three: Identify and specify which user from which you would like to retrieve their home timeline for  \nYou must specify a user you would like to retrieve recent Tweets for within the request. In this example, we will be passing a single user ID.  \nUser IDs are simply the numerical value that represents an account handle that you can find within an account's profile URL. For example, the following account\u2019s username is `TwitterDev`.  \n`https://twitter.com/TwitterDev`  \nTo convert this username to the user ID, you will have to use the [users lookup endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/quick-start)\u00a0with the username and find the numerical user ID in the payload. In the case of @TwitterDev, the user ID is\u00a02244994945.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this user ID into the \"Value\" column of the id\u00a0parameter.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | 2244994945 |  \n#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet) fields in your response: id,\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields,\u00a0you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request three additional different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.  \n2. The associated authors\u2019 user object\u2019s default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username\n3. The additional\u00a0user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |\n| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |\n| max\\_results | 5   |     |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/users/:id/timelines/reverse_chronological?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at&max_results=5`  \n**Please note:**  \nIn Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id`\u00a0params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 2244994945.  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{ \t\"data\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2022-05-12T17:00:00.000Z\", \t\t\t\"text\": \"Today marks the launch of Devs in the Details, a technical video series made for developers by developers building with the Twitter API.  \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nIn this premiere episode, @jessicagarson walks us through how she built @FactualCat #WelcomeToOurTechTalk\\n\u2b07\ufe0f\\n\\nhttps://t.co/nGa8JTQVBJ\", \t\t\t\"author_id\": \"2244994945\", \t\t\t\"id\": \"1524796546306478083\" \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2022-05-11T19:16:40.000Z\", \t\t\t\"text\": \"\ud83d\udce2 Join @jessicagarson @alanbenlee and @i_am_daniele tomorrow, May 12  | 5:30 ET / 2:30pm PT as they discuss the future of bots https://t.co/sQ2bIO1fz6\", \t\t\t\"author_id\": \"2244994945\", \t\t\t\"id\": \"1524468552404668416\" \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2022-05-09T20:12:01.000Z\", \t\t\t\"text\": \"Do you make bots with the Twitter API? \ud83e\udd16\\n\\nJoin @jessicagarson @alanbenlee and @iamdaniele on Thursday, May 12  | 5:30 ET / 2:30pm PT as they discuss the future of bots and answer any questions you might have. \ud83c\udf99\ud83d\udcc6\u2b07\ufe0f\\n\\nhttps://t.co/2uVt7hCcdG\", \t\t\t\"author_id\": \"2244994945\", \t\t\t\"id\": \"1523757705436958720\" \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2022-05-06T18:19:54.000Z\", \t\t\t\"text\": \"If you\u2019d like to apply, or would like to nominate someone else for the program, please feel free to fill out the following form:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/LUuWj24HLu\", \t\t\t\"author_id\": \"2244994945\", \t\t\t\"id\": \"1522642324781633536\" \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2022-05-06T18:19:53.000Z\", \t\t\t\"text\": \"We\u2019ve gone into more detail on each Insider in our forum post. \\n\\nJoin us in congratulating the new additions! \ud83e\udd73\\n\\nhttps://t.co/0r5maYEjPJ\", \t\t\t\"author_id\": \"2244994945\", \t\t\t\"id\": \"1522642323535847424\" \t\t} \t], \t\"includes\": { \t\t\"users\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"created_at\": \"2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z\", \t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Twitter Dev\", \t\t\t\t\"username\": \"TwitterDev\", \t\t\t\t\"id\": \"2244994945\" \t\t\t} \t\t] \t}, \t\"meta\": { \t\t\"result_count\": 5, \t\t\"newest_id\": \"1524796546306478083\", \t\t\"oldest_id\": \"1522642323535847424\", \t\t\"next_token\": \"7140dibdnow9c7btw421dyz6jism75z99gyxd8egarsc4\" \t} }`  \n####\nStep six: Paginate through your results  \nIn the previous response, you will find a meta\u00a0data object at the bottom that includes the following fields:  \n* oldest\\_id\n* newest\\_id\n* results\\_count\n* next\\_token\n* previous\\_token  \nIn step four, we passed a max\\_results value of 5, meaning that each page will only include up to five results.

In the case of @TwitterDev, the user ID is\u00a02244994945.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this user ID into the \"Value\" column of the id\u00a0parameter.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | 2244994945 |  \n#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet) fields in your response: id and text.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond id and text, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a three additional different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.  \n2. The associated authors\u2019 user object\u2019s default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username\n3. The additional\u00a0 user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |\n| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |\n| max\\_results | 5   |     |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/users/:id/tweets?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at&max_results=5`  \n**Please note:**  \nIn Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id`\u00a0params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 2244994945.  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{     \"data\": [         {             \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",             \"created_at\": \"2020-09-03T17:31:39.000Z\",             \"id\": \"1301573587187331074\",             \"text\": \"Starting today, you can see your monthly Tweet usage for the v2 API in the developer portal. \u2728\ud83d\udcca\\n\\nThis tracks how many Tweets you\u2019ve received from filtered stream and recent search.

We\u2019ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).  \n#### Libraries  \nTake advantage of one of our many\u00a0[community third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.  \n#### Postman  \nPostman is a great tool that you can use to test out these endpoints. Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our [Using Postman](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman) page.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/timelines/integrate\n\tHow to integrate with the Timelines endpoints\n\tKey concepts\n\nContent: \n### Key concepts  \n#### Authentication  \nAll Twitter API v2 endpoints require requests to be [authenticated](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication) with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens. You can use either OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE to authenticate requests to these endpoints. You can use OAuth 2.0 App-Only for user Tweets timeline and user mentions timeline.  \n[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0requires you to utilize your\u00a0API Keys, user Access Tokens, and a handful of other parameters to\u00a0[create an authorization header](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request), which you will then pass with your request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize your App using the\u00a0[3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth 1.0a can be difficult to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a\u00a0[library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), use\u00a0a tool like Postman, or use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate your requests. If you would like to request a Tweet or private metrics from these endpoints, you will need to use a either OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE, which will ensure that you have the proper permissions from the user that owns that content.  \n[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0)\u00a0just requires that you pass an\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)\u00a0with your request. You can either generate an App Access Token from directly within a developer App, or generate one using the\u00a0[POST oauth2/token](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference/token)\u00a0endpoint. You can use this for user Tweets timeline or user mention timeline.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)\u00a0allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user.  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your\u2019s App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.  \n**Please note**  \nIf you are requesting the following [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields), OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code is required:  \n* `tweet.fields.non_public_metrics`\n* `tweet.fields.promoted_metrics`\n* `tweet.fields.organic_metrics`\n* `media.fields.non_public_metrics`\n* `media.fields.promoted_metrics`\n* `media.fields.organic_metrics`  \n#### [](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination)Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo work with any Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must [sign up for a\u00a0developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that Project. Your keys and tokens within that developer App will work for these timelines endpoints.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the volume, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that every developer can make on behalf of an app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThere are different rate limits applied for these endpoints depending on which authentication method is being used. The app-level rate limits apply to an App making requests using OAuth 2.0 App-Only, whereas the user-level rate limit applies to requests being made on behalf of the specific authorizing user using OAuth 1.0a User Context. These two rate limits are based on the frequency of requests within a 15-minute window.  \nFor example, an app using OAuth 2.0 App-Only auth for both of these timelines endpoints, can make 1500 requests (including pagination requests) to the user Tweet timeline, and 450 requests (including pagination requests) to the user mention timeline within a 15-minute timeframe.\u00a0 That same app, within the same 15-minute timeframe, with two different authorized users (using OAuth 1.0a User Context) can make 900 requests (including pagination requests) to the user Tweet timeline, and 180 requests (including pagination requests) to the user mention timeline for each authenticated user.  \nReverse chronological home timeline\u00a0has a per-user rate limit of 180 requests per a 15 min window. With this endpoint you can return every Tweet created on a timeline over the last 7 days as well as the most recent 800 regardless of creation date.  \n#### Fields and expansions  \nThe Twitter API v2 allows you to select exactly which data you want returned from the API using [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions). The expansion parameter allows you to expand objects referenced in the payload. For example, this endpoint allows you to request poll, place, media, and other objects using the expansions parameter.  \nThe fields parameter allows you to select exactly which fields within the different data objects you would like to receive. By default, the primary Tweet object returned by these endpoints include the id and text fields. To receive additional fields such as author\\_id or public\\_metrics, you will have to specifically request those using the fields parameters. Some important fields that you may want to consider using in your integration are our poll data, [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics), [Tweet annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations), and [conversation ID](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) fields.  \nWe\u2019ve added a guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions) together to our [Twitter API v2 data dictionary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary).  \n#### Tweet metrics  \nThe Twitter API v2 endpoints allow you to request Tweet metrics directly from the returned Tweet object, assuming you pass the proper fields with your request.  \nThere are some limitations with Tweet metrics that you should be aware of, specifically related to user privacy and the following response fields:  \n* `tweet.fields.non_public_metrics`\n* `tweet.fields.promoted_metrics`\n* `tweet.fields.organic_metrics`\n* `media.fields.non_public_metrics`\n* `media.fields.promoted_metrics`\n* `media.fields.organic_metrics`  \nThe noted fields include private metrics data, meaning you must be authorized by the Tweet\u2019s publisher to retrieve this data on their behalf when using the user Tweet timeline endpoint, meaning you must use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code).  \nFor example, in order to receive non\\_public\\_metrics for user ID 1234's user Tweet timeline you will need to include access tokens associated with that user in your request. You can have users authorize your app and receive a set of access tokens associated with them by using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nIf you are using user mention timeline, the noted fields will not be available unless the mentioning author has authorized your App to access their private metrics data and you are using that user\u2019s access tokens when making the request with OAuth 1.0a User Context.  \nAll non\\_public\\_metrics, organic\\_metrics, and promoted\\_metrics are only available for Tweets created in the last 30 days. This means that when you are requesting the noted fields, the results will automatically adjust to only include Tweets from the last 30 days.  \nIf these noted fields are requested, only Tweets that are authored by the authenticated user will be returned, all other Tweets will receive an error message.  \n#### Pagination  \nThese endpoints utilize pagination so that responses are returned quickly. In cases where there are more results than what can be sent in a single response (up to 100 Tweets for the timelines endpoints) you will need to paginate. Use the max\\_results parameter to identify how many results will return per page, and the pagination\\_token parameter return the next page of results. You can learn more by reviewing our [pagination guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination).  \n#### Filtering results  \nThese endpoints include several parameters that you can use to filter results. Using start\\_date and end\\_date, you can narrow down results to a specific timeframe. If you\u2019d rather use Tweet IDs to select a specific set of Tweets, you can use the since\\_id and until\\_id. The user Tweets timeline also has an exclude parameter that can remove Retweets and Replies from your results.  \n#### Tweet caps and volume of Tweets returned  \nThe user Tweet timeline and user mention timeline endpoints are limited in the number of Tweets that they can return in a given month.\u00a0The reverse chronological home timeline endpoint is not subject to this limitation.  \nRegardless of which timelines endpoint you use, the Tweets returned will count towards the Project-level [Tweet caps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps).\u00a0Usage is shown in the developer portal, and the 'month' starts on your subscription renewal day shown on the [developer portal dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).  \nThe user Tweet timeline endpoint will only return the most recent 3200 Tweets posted to a user\u2019s timeline. Setting start\\_time and end\\_time to a time period that includes Tweets beyond the 3200 most recent, you will receive a successful response, but no Tweets.  \nIt is also important to note that, if you pass the excludes=replies with your user Tweet timeline requests, only the most recent 800 Tweets will be returned.  \nThe user mention timeline endpoint will only return the most recent 800 Tweet mentions.  \nThe reverse chronological home timeline endpoint returns the last 3200 Tweets.  \n#### Tweet edits  \nTweets that are eligible for edits can be edited up to five times in the 30 minutes after the original Tweet was published. The search endpoints will always provide the latest version of the Tweet. If you only request Tweets that were published 30 or more minutes ago, you will always receive the final version of the Tweet. However, if you have a near-real-time use case, and are querying Tweets published within the last thirty minutes, those Tweets could have been edited after you received them. These Tweets can be rehydrated with search, or the Tweet Lookup endpoint to confirm their final state. To learn more about how Tweet edits work, see the [Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) page.  \n#### Edge cases  \n* When requesting non-public metrics on the User Tweet timeline endpoint for Tweets that are older than 30 days, you may see a next\\_token in the response with a result count of 0. To avoid encountering this issue, ensure that the timeframe requested with the non\\_public\\_metrics parameter is within the most recent 30 days. Additionally, the max\\_results minimum value should be 10. These may help to avoid this scenario, but this could still occur.\n* Requesting promoted metrics for Tweets that were not promoted returns an empty response, instead of Tweet data. Our team is currently working on fixing this issue.  \n* For a Retweet that contains Tweet body text greater than 140 characters in length, the text field will be truncated instead of returning the full Tweet text. The short term workaround is to expand the referenced Tweet and retrieve the full text from the expansion. This is a bug that we will fix in the future.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.  \n#### Rate Limits  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **mentions\\_timeline:**<br><br>75 requests per 15 min with OAuth 1.0a User Context | **user mention timeline:**\u00a0<br><br>180 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context  <br>450 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token |\n| **home\\_timelime:**<br><br>15 requests per 15 minutes  <br><br>Up to 800 Tweets are obtainable on the home timeline | **reverse chronological home timeline:**<br><br>180 requests per 15 minutes<br><br>You can return every Tweet created on a timeline over the last 7 days as well as the most recent 800 regardless of creation date. |  \n#### Request limits  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard timelines v1.1** | **timelines v2** |\n| Daily request limit<br><br>* 100,000 request cap within a 24 hour period. | No daily request limits, only limited by consumption volume. |  \n#### Consumption volume limits  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard timelines v1.1** | **timelines v2** |\n| Consumption limited only by request limits<br><br>* 100,000 request cap within a 24 hour period. | Consumption limited by only Project-level monthly [Tweet cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps) (across multiple v2 endpoints) based on [access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level).<br><br>* 500,000 Tweets per month with Essential access.<br>* 2 million Tweets per month with Elevated access<br>* 10 million Tweets per month with Academic Research access\u00a0<br><br>Reverse\u00a0chronological home timeline is not subject to the monthly Tweet cap. |  \n#### Request parameters  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard timelines v1.1** | **timelines v2** |\n| Required: user\\_id or screen\\_name | Required: The specific user ID is specified in the path parameter |\n| Optional:<br><br>count\u00a0- sets the maximum results returned per request<br><br>exclude\\_replies\u00a0- removes replies from the results<br><br>Include\\_rts\u00a0- when set to 0 removes retweets from the results<br><br>trim\\_user\u00a0- removes rehydrated user objects from the results<br><br>tweet\\_mode\u00a0- sets the data format returned for the results, set to extended for Tweets longer than 140<br><br>since\\_id\u00a0- sets the earliest Tweet ID in result (exclusive)<br><br>max\\_id\u00a0- sets the latest Tweet ID in result (inclusive) | Optional:<br><br>max\\_results\u00a0- sets the maximum results returned per request<br><br>exclude=retweets,replies\u00a0- removes Retweets or replies from the results<br><br>tweet.fields\u00a0- sets the Tweet object fields to return<br><br>user.fields\u00a0- sets the User object fields to return<br><br>place.fields\u00a0- sets the place object fields to return<br><br>media.fields\u00a0- sets the media object fields to return<br><br>poll.fields\u00a0- sets the poll object fields to return<br><br>expansions\u00a0- sets the expanded fields and data to return<br><br>start\\_time\u00a0- sets the earliest created\\_at time for the results<br><br>end\\_time\u00a0- sets the latest created\\_at time for the results<br><br>since\\_id\u00a0- sets the earliest Tweet ID for the\u00a0 results (exclusive)<br><br>until\\_id\u00a0- sets the latest Tweet ID in result (exclusive) |  \n**Response data format**  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard search v1.1** | **Search Tweets v2** |\n| \\[<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 {tweet object},<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 {tweet object}<br>\u00a0 \\] | {<br>  \"data\": \\[{id,text},{id,text}\\],<br>  \"meta\": {<br>    \"oldest\\_id\": \"1337085692623646724\",<br>    \"newest\\_id\": \"1334183616172019713\",<br>    \"previous\\_token\": \"77qpymm88g5h9vqkluldpw91lr0qzfz1sqydh841iz48k\",<br>    \"result\\_count\": 10,<br>    \"next\\_token\": \"7140dibdnow9c7btw3w29gqolns6a1ipl3kzeae41vsxk\"<br>  }<br>} |  \n#### Twitter API v2 JSON format  \nTwitter API v2 is introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.\u00a0You can learn more about the Twitter API v2 format, how to use fields and expansions by visiting our\u00a0[guide](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions), and by reading through our broader\u00a0[data dictionary](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary)  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as contributors and user.translator\\_type are being removed.\n* Instead of using both favorites (in Tweet object) and favorites (in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example, null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null value.  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload. For the standard endpoints, there are several parameters that you could use to identify which fields or sets of fields would return in the payload, while the Twitter API v2 version simplifies these different parameters into [fields](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions).  \n* fields: Twitter API v2 endpoints enable you to select which fields are provided in your payload. For example, Tweet, user, Media, Place, and Poll objects all have a list of fields that can be returned (or not).\n* expansions: Used to expand the complementary objects referenced in Tweet JSON payloads. For example, all Retweets and Replies reference other Tweets. By setting expansions=referenced\\_tweets.id, these other Tweet objects are expanded according to the tweet.fields setting.\u00a0 Other objects such as users, polls, and media can be expanded.  \n* conversation\\_id\n* Two new [annotations](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations) fields, including context and entities\n* Several new [metrics](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics) fields  \nWe have put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.\n",

While this functionality is present in Twitter, these endpoints provide greater flexibility and power when filtering for and ingesting Tweets so you can find relevant data for your research more easily; build out near-real-time \u2018listening\u2019 applications; or generally explore, analyze, and/or act upon Tweets related to a topic of interest.  \nWe offer two endpoints that allow you to search for Tweets: Recent search and full-archive search. Both of these REST endpoints share a common design and features, including their use of a single search query to filter for Tweets around a specific topic. These search queries are created with a set of operators that match on Tweet and user attributes, such as message keywords, hashtags, and URLs. Operators can be combined into queries with boolean logic and parentheses to help refine the queries matching behavior.  \nBoth the recent search and the full-archive search endpoints provide edited Tweet metadata. All objects for Tweets created since September 29, 2022, include Tweet edit metadata, even if the Tweet was never edited. Each time a Tweet is edited, a new Tweet ID is created. A Tweet's edit history is documented by an array of Tweet IDs, starting with the original ID.  \nThese endpoints will always return the most recent edit, along with any edit history. Any Tweet collected after its 30-minute edit window will represent its final version. To learn more about Edit Tweet metadata, check out the [Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) page.  \nOnce you\u2019ve set up your query and start receiving Tweets, these endpoints support navigating the results both by time and Tweet ID ranges. This is designed to support two common use cases:  \n* **Get historical**: Requests are for a period of interest, with no focus on the real-time nature of the data. A single request is made, and all matching data is delivered using pagination as needed. This is the default mode for Search Tweets.\n* **Polling** or **listening**: Requests are made in a \"any new Tweets since my last request?\" mode. Requests are made on a continual basis, and typically there is a use case focused on near real-time 'listening' for Tweets of interest.  \nMany operators and query limits are exclusive to\u00a0[Enterprise access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level), meaning that you must use keys and tokens from an App within a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) with Enterprise access to utilize the additional functionality. You can learn more about this in the endpoint sections below.  \nBoth the recent search and the full-archive search endpoints returned Tweets contribute to the monthly\u00a0[Tweet cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).\n",

To do this with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication methods.  \nFor simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics) or Tweets.  \nTo utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three: Create a search query  \nEach recent search query requires a single [search query](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-rule). For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Tweets posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from operator and set it to XDevelopers\u00a0(case insensitive):  \n`from:XDevelopers`  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Tweet IDs separated by a comma, into the \"Value\" column of the `ids` parameter.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |\n| `query` | from:XDevelopers | Search query to submit to the recent search endpoint |  \n#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) fields in your response: id\u00a0,\u00a0text, and\u00a0 edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids. If you would like to receive additional fields beyond id\u00a0,\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a four different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The default Tweet object fields.\n2. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.\n3.

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with the [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) authentication methods.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThis variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three: Create a search query  \nEach full-archive search query requires a single search query. For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Tweets posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from operator and set it to XDevelopers (case insensitive):  \n`from:XDevelopers`  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Tweet IDs separated by a comma, into the \"Value\" column of the `ids` parameter.  \n| Key | Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `query` | `from:XDevelopers` | Search query to submit to the full-archive search endpoint |  \nStep four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) fields in your response: `id`\u00a0,`text`, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids. Note that if you receive Tweets from before editing was supported, the edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids field will not be provided. No history backfill was performed for this field.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond these default fields,\u00a0you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a four different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The default Tweet object fields\n2. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects\n3. The associated authors\u2019 [user object\u2019s](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) default fields for the returned Tweets\n4. The additional user.description field in the associated user objects  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n| Key | Value | Returned fields |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | includes.users.id, includes.users.name, includes.users.username |\n| user.fields | description | includes.users.description |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all?query=from:XDevelopers&tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at`  \n**Please note**  \nBy default, only 10 most recent Tweets will be returned. If you want more than 10 Tweets per request, you can use the max\\_results parameter and set it to a maximum of 500 Tweets per request. Similarly,\u00a0 by default Tweets from the last 30 days will be returned. If you want to get Tweets that are older than 30 days, you can use the start\\_time and end\\_time parameters in your API call.  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive a response similar to the following:  \n`{    \"data\": [        {            \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",            \"created_at\": \"2020-06-11T16:05:06.000Z\",            \"id\": \"1271111223220809728\",            \"text\": \"Tune in tonight and watch as @jessicagarson takes us through running your favorite Python package in R. \ud83c\udf7f\\n\\nLearn how to use two powerful programming languages for data science together, and see a live example that uses the recent search endpoint from Twitter\u2019s Developer Labs. https://t.co/v178oUZNuj\"        },        {            \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",            \"created_at\": \"2020-06-10T19:25:24.000Z\",            \"id\": \"1270799243071062016\",            \"text\": \"As we work towards building the new Twitter API, we\u2019ve extended the deprecation timeline for several Labs v1 endpoints.

You must use OAuth 2.0 App-Only when using the full archive search endpoint.  \n[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0)\u00a0just requires that you pass an\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)\u00a0with your request. You can either generate an App Access Token from directly within a developer App, or generate one using the\u00a0[POST oauth2/token](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference/token)\u00a0endpoint.  \n[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0requires you to utilize your\u00a0API Keys, user Access Tokens, and a handful of other parameters to\u00a0[create an authorization header](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request), which you will then pass with your request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize your App using the\u00a0[3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nPlease note that OAuth 1.0a can be difficult to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a\u00a0[library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), use\u00a0a tool like Postman, or use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate your requests. If you would like to request a Tweet or private metrics from these endpoints, you will need to use a either OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE, which will ensure that you have the proper permissions from the user that owns that content.  \n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)\u00a0allows for greater control over an application\u2019s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user.  \nTo enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your\u2019s App\u2019s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.  \n**Please note**  \nIf you are requesting the following [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields), OAuth 1.0a User Context or\u00a0OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code is required:  \n* tweet.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.organic\\_metrics\n* media.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* media.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* media.fields.organic\\_metrics  \n####\nDeveloper portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo work with any Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must have [signed up for a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info), set up a Project within that account, and created a developer App within that Project. Your keys and tokens within that developer App will work for these search endpoints.  \nYou can use keys and tokens from a Project with any [access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level) to make requests to the recent search endpoint. However, you will need to use Project with the Pro or Enterprise access level to make requests to the full archive search endpoint. If you have [Enterprise access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level), you will have access to additional functionality, including the availability of additional operators and longer query lengths.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the volume, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that every developer can make on behalf of an app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThere are different rate limits applied for these endpoints depending on which authentication method is being used. The app-level rate limits apply to an App making requests using OAuth 2.0 App-Only, whereas the user-level rate limit applies to requests being made on behalf of the specific authorizing user using OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE. These two rate limits are based on the frequency of requests within a 15-minute window.  \nFor example, an app using OAuth 2.0 App-Only auth to make requests to the recent search endpoint can make 450 requests (including pagination requests) within a 15-minute timeframe. That same app, within the same 15-minute timeframe and with two different authenticated users (using OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE) can make up to 180 requests (including pagination requests) to the recent search endpoint for each authenticated user.  \n#### Fields and expansions  \nThe Twitter API v2 allows you to select exactly which data you want returned from the API using [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions). The expansion parameter allows you to expand objects referenced in the payload. For example, this endpoint allows you to request poll, place, media, and other objects using the expansions parameter.  \nThe fields parameters allows you to select exactly which fields within the different data objects you would like to receive. By default, the primary Tweet object returned by these endpoints include the id and text fields (in addition to edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids for Tweets created after that feature was launched). To receive additional fields such as author\\_id or public\\_metrics, you will have to specifically request those using the fields parameters. Some important fields that you may want to consider using in your integration are our poll data, [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics), [Tweet annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations), and [conversation ID](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) fields.  \nWe\u2019ve added a guide on how to [use fields and expansions together](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions) to our [Twitter API v2 data dictionary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary).  \n#### Metrics  \nThe Twitter API v2 endpoints allow you to request metrics directly from the returned objects, assuming you pass the proper [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) with your request.  \nThere are some limitations with Tweet metrics that you should be aware of, specifically related to user privacy and the following response fields:  \n* tweet.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.organic\\_metrics\n* media.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* media.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* media.fields.organic\\_metrics  \nThe noted fields include private metrics data, meaning you must be authorized by the Tweet\u2019s publisher to retrieve this data on their behalf when using the recent search endpoint, meaning you must use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a). Since you can only use this authentication method using recent search, you will not be able to retrieve these metrics via the full archive search endpoint.  \nFor example, in order to receive non\\_public\\_metrics for user ID 1234's Tweets, you will need to include access tokens associated with that user in your request. You can have users authorize your app and receive a set of access tokens associated with them by using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens).  \nAll non\\_public\\_metrics, organic\\_metrics, and promoted\\_metrics are only available for Tweets created in the last 30 days. This means that when you are requesting the noted fields, the results will automatically adjust to only include Tweets from the last 30 days.  \nIf these noted fields are requested, only Tweets that are authored by the authenticated user will be returned, all other Tweets will receive an error message.  \n#### Building search queries  \nThe central feature of these endpoints is their use of a single search query to filter the Tweets that deliver to you. These queries are made up of operators that match on Tweet and user attributes, such as message keywords, hashtags, and URLs. Operators can be combined into queries with boolean logic and parentheses to help refine the query's matching behavior.  \nYou can use our guide on [how to build a query](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query) to learn more.  \nWe have also written a more in-depth tutorial on how to [build high-quality filters for getting Twitter data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/building-high-quality-filters).  \n#### Pagination  \nThese endpoints utilize pagination so that responses are returned quickly. In cases where there are more results than what can be sent in a single response (up to 100 Tweets for recent search and 500 for full-archive search) you will need to paginate. Use the max\\_results parameter to identify how many results will return per page, and the pagination\\_token parameter to return the next page of results. You can learn more by reviewing our [pagination guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination).  \n#### Tweet caps  \nThe Search Tweets endpoints are limited in the number of Tweets that they can return in a given month, regardless of pagination.  \nRegardless of which search endpoint you use, the Tweets returned will count towards the Project-level [Tweet caps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps). Usage is shown in the developer portal, and the 'month' starts on your subscription renewal day shown on the [developer portal dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).  \n**Tweet edits**  \nTweets that are eligible for edits can be edited up to five times in the 30 minutes after the original Tweet was published. The search endpoints will always provide the latest version of the Tweet. If you only request Tweets that were published 30 or more minutes ago, you will always receive the final version of the Tweet. However, if you have a near-real-time use case, and are querying Tweets published within the last thirty minutes, those Tweets could have been edited after you received them. These Tweets can be rehydrated with search, or the Tweet Lookup endpoint to confirm their final state. To learn more about how Tweet edits work, see the [Tweet edits fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-edits) page.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query\n\tBuilding queries for Search Tweets\n\tBuilding a query\n\nContent: \n### Building a query  \n#### Query limitations  \nYour queries will be limited depending on which [access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level)\u00a0you are using.  \nIf you have Basic or Pro access, your query can be 512 characters long for recent search endpoint.  \nIf you have Pro access, your query can be 1,024 characters long for full archive search endpoint.  \n#### Operator availability  \nWhile most operators are available to any developer, there are several that are reserved for certain access levels. We list which access level each operator is available to in the\u00a0[list of operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query#list)\u00a0table using the following labels:  \n* **Core operators:**\u00a0Available when using any\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).\n* **Advanced operators:**\u00a0Available when using a Project with certain access level  \n#### Operator types: standalone and conjunction-required  \n**Standalone operators**\u00a0can be used alone or together with any other operators (including those that require conjunction).  \nFor example, the following query will work because it uses the\u00a0#hashtag\u00a0operator, which is standalone:  \n#twitterapiv2  \n**Conjunction-required**\u00a0operators cannot be used by themselves in a query; they can only be used when at least one standalone operator is included in the query. This is because using these operators alone would be far too general, and would match on an extremely high volume of Tweets.  \nFor example, the following queries are not supported since they contain only conjunction-required operators:  \nhas:media\nhas:links OR is:retweet  \nIf we add in a standalone operator, such as the phrase\u00a0\"twitter data\", the query would then work properly.  \n\"twitter data\" has:mentions (has:media OR has:links)  \n####\nBoolean operators and grouping  \nIf you would like to string together multiple operators in a single query, you have the following tools at your disposal:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **AND logic** | Successive operators with a space between them will result in boolean \"AND\" logic, meaning that Tweets will match only if both conditions are met. For example,\u00a0snow day #NoSchool\u00a0will match Tweets containing the terms snow and day and the hashtag #NoSchool. |\n| **OR logic** | Successive operators with OR between them will result in OR logic, meaning that Tweets will match if either condition is met. For example, specifying\u00a0grumpy OR cat OR #meme\u00a0will match any Tweets containing at least the terms grumpy or cat, or the hashtag #meme. |\n| **NOT logic, negation** | Prepend a dash (-) to a keyword (or any operator) to negate it (NOT). For example,\u00a0cat #meme -grumpy\u00a0will match Tweets containing the hashtag #meme and the term cat, but only if they do not contain the term grumpy. One common query clause is\u00a0\\-is:retweet, which will not match on Retweets, thus matching only on original Tweets, Quote Tweets, and replies. All operators can be negated, but negated operators cannot be used alone. |\n| **Grouping** | You can use parentheses to group operators together. For example,\u00a0(grumpy cat) OR (#meme has:images)\u00a0will return either Tweets containing the terms grumpy and cat, or Tweets with images containing the hashtag #meme. Note that ANDs are applied first, then ORs are applied. |  \n**A note on negations**  \nThe operators\u00a0\\-is:nullcast must always be negated.  \nNegated operators cannot be used alone.  \nDo not negate a set of operators grouped together in a set of parentheses. Instead, negate each individual operator. For example, instead of using skiing -(snow OR day OR noschool), we suggest that you use skiing -snow -day -noschool.  \n####\nOrder of operations  \nWhen combining AND and OR functionality, the following order of operations will dictate how your query is evaluated.  \n1. Operators connected by AND logic are combined first\n2. Then, operators connected with OR logic are applied  \nFor example:  \n* apple OR iphone ipad would be evaluated as apple OR (iphone ipad)\n* ipad iphone OR android would be evaluated as (iphone ipad) OR android  \nTo eliminate uncertainty and ensure that your query is evaluated as intended, group terms together with parentheses where appropriate.  \nFor example:  \n* (apple OR iphone) ipad\n* iphone (ipad OR android)  \n#### Punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity  \nIf you specify a keyword or hashtag query with character accents or diacritics, it will match Tweet text that contains both the term with the accents and diacritics, as well as those terms with normal characters. For example, queries with a keyword\u00a0Diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will match\u00a0_Diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_, as well as with\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e.  \nCharacters with accents or diacritics are treated the same as normal characters and are not treated as word boundaries. For example, a query with the keyword\u00a0cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0would only match activities containing the word\u00a0_cumplea\u00f1os_\u00a0and would not match activities containing\u00a0_cumplea_,\u00a0_cumplean_, or\u00a0_os_.  \nAll operators are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the query\u00a0cat\u00a0will match Tweets with all of the following:\u00a0_cat_,\u00a0_CAT_,\u00a0_Cat_.  \nThe\u00a0[filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream)\u00a0matching behavior acts differently from Search Tweets. When\u00a0[building a filtered stream rule](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule), know that keywords and hashtags that include accents and diacritics will only match on terms that also include the accent and diacritic, and will not match on terms that use normal characters instead.  \nFor example, filtered stream rules that include a keyword\u00a0Diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will only match the terms\u00a0_Diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0and\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_, and will not match on\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e  \n#### Specificity and efficiency  \nWhen you start to build your query, it is important to keep a few things in mind.  \n* Using broad, standalone operators for your query such as a single keyword or #hashtag is generally not recommended since it will likely match on a massive volume of Tweets. Creating a more robust query will result in a more specific set of matching Tweets, and will hopefully reduce the amount of noise in the payload that you will need to sift through to find valuable insights.\n* For example, if your query was just the keyword happy you will likely get anywhere from 200,000 - 300,000 Tweets per day.\n* Adding more conditional operators narrows your search results, for example (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet\n* Writing efficient queries is also beneficial for staying within the characters query length restriction. The character count includes the entire query string including spaces and operators.\n* For example, the following query is 59 characters long: (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet  \n####\nQuote Tweet matching behavior  \nWhen using the Search Tweets endpoints, operators will not match on the content from the original Tweet that was quoted, but will match on the content included in the Quote Tweet.  \nHowever, please note that [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream) will match on both the content from the original Tweet that was quoted and the Quote Tweet's content.  \n#### Iteratively building a query  \n##### Test your query early and often  \nGetting a query to return the \"right\" results the first time is rare. There is so much on Twitter that may or may not be obvious at first and the query syntax described above may be hard to match to your desired search. As you build a query, it is important for you to periodically test it out.  \nFor this section, we are going to start with the following query and adjust it based on the results that we receive during our test:  \nhappy OR happiness  \n##### Use results to narrow the query  \nAs you test the query, you should scan the returned Tweets to see if they include the data that you are expecting and hoping to receive. Starting with a broad query and a superset of Tweet matches allows you to review the result and narrow the query to filter out undesired results.  \nWhen we tested the example query, we noticed that we were getting Tweets in a variety of different languages. In this situation, we want to only receive Tweets that are in english, so we\u2019re going to add the lang: operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en  \nThe test delivered a number of Tweets wishing people a happy birthday, so we are going to add \\-birthday as a negated keyword operator. We also want to only receive original Tweets, so we\u2019ve added the negated \\-is:retweet operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for inclusion where needed  \nIf you notice that you are not receiving data that you expect and know that there are existing Tweets that should return, you may need to broaden your query by removing operators that may be filtering out the desired data.  \nFor our example, we noticed that there were other Tweets in our personal timeline that expressed the emotion that we are looking for and weren\u2019t included in the test results. To ensure we have greater coverage, we are going to add the keywords, excited and elated.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for popular trends/bursts over the time period  \nTrends come and go on Twitter quickly. Maintaining your query should be an active process. If you plan to use a query for a while, we suggest that you periodically check in on the data that you are receiving to see if you need to make any adjustments.  \nIn our example, we notice that we started to receive some Tweets that are wishing people a \u201chappy holidays\u201d. Since we don\u2019t want these Tweets included in our results, we are going to add a negated \\-holidays keyword.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet -holidays\n",

Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.  \nNote that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.  \nExample: (\ud83d\ude03 OR \ud83d\ude21) \ud83d\ude2c\"exact phrase match\"StandaloneEssentialMatches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.  \nExample: (\"Twitter API\" OR #v2) -\"recent search\"#StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet.  \nThis operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule #thanku will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.  \nExample: #thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande@StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).  \nExample: (@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter$StandaloneElevatedMatches any Tweet that contains the specified \u2018cashtag\u2019 (where the leading character of the token is the \u2018$\u2019 character).  \nNote that the cashtag operator relies on Twitter\u2019s \u2018symbols\u2019 entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.  \nExample: $twtr OR @twitterdev -$fbfrom:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet from a specific user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per from: operator.  \nExample: from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitterto:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per to: operator.  \nExample: to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitterurl:StandaloneEssentialPerforms a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.  \nThis operator can matches on the contents of both the url or expanded\\_url fields. For example, a Tweet containing \"You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4\" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:  \nfrom:TwitterDev url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\"\n(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.expanded\\_url)  \nfrom:TwitterDev url:\"https://t.co\"\n(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.url)  \nTokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, url:\"/developer\"). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\").retweets\\_of:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per retweets\\_of: operator.  \nExample: retweets\\_of:twitterdev OR retweets\\_of:twitterapi  \nin\\_reply\\_to\\_tweet\\_id:  \nStandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_ in\\_reply\\_to\\_status\\_id:  \nMatches on replies to the specified Tweet.  \nExample: in\\_reply\\_to\\_tweet\\_id:1539382664746020864  \nretweets\\_of\\_tweet\\_id:  \nStandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0retweets\\_of\\_status\\_id:  \nMatches on explicit (or native) Retweets of the specified Tweet.\u00a0Note that the Tweet ID used should be the ID of an original Tweet and not a Retweet.  \nExample:\u00a0retweets\\_of\\_tweet\\_id:1539382664746020864  \nquotes\\_of\\_tweet\\_id:  \nStandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0quotes\\_of\\_status\\_id:  \nMatches on Quote Tweets of the specified Tweet.\u00a0Note that the Tweet ID used should be the ID of an original Tweet and not a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: quotes\\_of\\_tweet\\_id:1539382664746020864  \ncontext:StandaloneEssential  \nMatches Tweets with a specific domain id/enitity id pair. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \nYou can only pass a single domain/entity per context: operator.  \ncontext:domain\\_id.entity\\_id  \nHowever, you can combine multiple domain/entities using the OR operator:  \n`(context:47.1139229372198469633 OR context:11.1088514520308342784)`  \nExamples:\ncontext:10.799022225751871488\n(domain\\_id.entity\\_id returns Tweets matching that specific domain-entity pair)  \nentity:StandaloneEssential  \nMatches Tweets with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \n**Please note** that this is only available with recent search.  \nYou can only pass a single entity: operator.  \nentity:\"string declaration of entity/place\"  \nExamples: entity:\"Michael Jordan\" OR entity:\"Barcelona\"  \nconversation\\_id:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Tweet ID of a Tweet that started a conversation. As Replies to a Tweet are posted, even Replies to Replies, the conversation\\_id is added to its JSON payload.  \nYou can only pass a single conversation ID per conversation\\_id: operator.  \nExample: conversation\\_id:1334987486343299072 (from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi)list:StandaloneElevated  \n**NEW**\u00a0Matches Tweets posted by users who are members of a specified list.  \nFor example, if @twitterdev and @twitterapi were members of List 123, and you included list:123 in your query, your response will only contain Tweets that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the [List lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/lists/lists-lookup) endpoint.  \n**Please note**\u00a0that you can only use a single list: operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per list: operator.  \nExample: list:123  \nplace:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets tagged with the specified location or Twitter place ID. Multi-word place names (\u201cNew York City\u201d, \u201cPalo Alto\u201d) should be enclosed in quotes.  \nYou can only pass a single place per place: operator.  \nNote: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain Twitter place IDs.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: place:\"new york city\" OR place:seattle OR place:fd70c22040963ac7place\\_country:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets where the country code associated with a tagged place/location matches the given ISO alpha-2 character code.  \nYou can find a list of valid ISO codes on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).  \nYou can only pass a single ISO code per place\\_country: operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: place\\_country:US OR place\\_country:MX OR place\\_country:CApoint\\_radius:StandaloneElevated  \nMatches against the place.geo.coordinates object of the Tweet when present, and in Twitter, against a place geo polygon, where the Place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.  \npoint\\_radius:\\[longitude latitude radius\\]  \n* Units of radius supported are miles (mi) and kilometers (km)  \n* Radius must be less than 25mi  \n* Longitude is in the range of \u00b1180  \n* Latitude is in the range of \u00b190  \n* All coordinates are in decimal degrees  \n* Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited  \nYou can only pass a single geo polygon per point\\_radius: operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet.

It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: bounding\\_box:\\[-105.301758 39.964069 -105.178505 40.09455\\]  \nis:retweetConjunction requiredEssentialMatches on Retweets that match the rest of the specified rule. This operator looks only for true Retweets (for example, those generated using the Retweet button). Quote Tweets will not be matched by this operator.  \nExample: data @twitterdev -is:retweetis:replyConjunction requiredEssentialDeliver only explicit replies that match a rule. Can also be negated to exclude replies that match a query from delivery.  \nNote: This operator is also available with the filtered stream endpoint. When used with filtered stream, this operator matches on replies to an original Tweet, replies in quoted Tweets, and replies in Retweets.  \nExample: from:twitterdev is:replyis:quoteConjunction requiredEssentialReturns all Quote Tweets, also known as Tweets with comments.  \nExample: \"sentiment analysis\" is:quoteis:verifiedConjunction requiredEssentialDeliver only Tweets whose authors are verified by Twitter.  \nExample: #nowplaying is:verified\\-is:nullcastConjunction requiredElevatedRemoves Tweets created for promotion only on ads.twitter.com that have a \"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers (legacy)\" or \"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers\".\nThis operator must be negated.  \nFor more info on Nullcasted Tweets, see our page on [Tweet availability](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/guides/tweet-availability).  \nExample: \"mobile games\" -is:nullcasthas:hashtagsConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that contain at least one hashtag.  \nExample: from:twitterdev -has:hashtagshas:cashtagsConjunction requiredElevatedMatches Tweets that contain a cashtag symbol (with a leading \u2018$\u2019 character. For example, $tag).  \nExample: #stonks has:cashtagshas:linksConjunction requiredEssentialThis operator matches Tweets which contain links and media in the Tweet body.  \nExample: from:twitterdev announcement has:linkshas:mentionsConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that mention another Twitter user.  \nExample: #nowplaying has:mentionshas:mediaConjunction requiredEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0has:media\\_link  \nMatches Tweets that contain a media object, such as a photo, GIF, or video, as determined by Twitter.

This will not match on videos created with Periscope, or Tweets with links to other video hosting sites.  \nExample: #icebucketchallenge has:video\\_link  \nhas:geoConjunction requiredElevatedMatches Tweets that have Tweet-specific geolocation data provided by the Twitter user. This can be either a location in the form of a Twitter place, with the corresponding display name, geo polygon, and other fields, or in rare cases, a geo lat-long coordinate.  \nNote: Operators matching on place (Tweet geo) will only include matches from original tweets. Retweets do not contain any place data.  \nExample: recommend #paris has:geo -bakerylang:Conjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the Tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so AND\u2019ing together multiple languages will yield no results.  \nYou can only pass a single BCP 47 language identifier per lang: operator.  \nNote: if no language classification can be made the provided result is \u2018und\u2019 (for undefined).  \nExample: recommend #paris lang:en  \nThe list below represents the currently supported languages and their corresponding BCP 47 language identifier:  \n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amharic: am | German: de | Malayalam: ml | Slovak: sk |\n| Arabic: ar | Greek: el | Maldivian: dv | Slovenian: sl |\n| Armenian: hy | Gujarati: gu | Marathi: mr | Sorani Kurdish: ckb |\n| Basque: eu | Haitian Creole: ht | Nepali: ne | Spanish: es |\n| Bengali: bn | Hebrew: iw | Norwegian: no | Swedish: sv |\n| Bosnian: bs | Hindi: hi | Oriya: or | Tagalog: tl |\n| Bulgarian: bg | Latinized Hindi: hi-Latn | Panjabi: pa | Tamil: ta |\n| Burmese: my | Hungarian: hu | Pashto: ps | Telugu: te |\n| Croatian: hr | Icelandic: is | Persian: fa | Thai: th |\n| Catalan: ca | Indonesian: in | Polish: pl | Tibetan: bo |\n| Czech: cs | Italian: it | Portuguese: pt | Traditional Chinese: zh-TW |\n| Danish: da | Japanese: ja | Romanian: ro | Turkish: tr |\n| Dutch: nl | Kannada: kn | Russian: ru | Ukrainian: uk |\n| English: en | Khmer: km | Serbian: sr | Urdu: ur |\n| Estonian: et | Korean: ko | Simplified Chinese: zh-CN | Uyghur: ug |\n| Finnish: fi | Lao: lo | Sindhi: sd | Vietnamese: vi |\n| French: fr | Latvian: lv | Sinhala: si | Welsh: cy |\n| Georgian: ka | Lithuanian: lt |     |\n",

When that happens, the data is returned in a series of 'pages'. Pagination refers to methods for requesting all of the pages in order to retrieve the entire data set.  \nHere are fundamental recent search pagination details:  \n* The recent search endpoints will respond to a query with at least one page, and provide a next\\_token in its JSON response if additional pages are available. To receive matching Tweets, this process can be repeated until no token is included in the response.\n* The\u00a0next\\_token does not expire. Multiple requests using the same next\\_token\u00a0value will receive the same results, regardless of when the request is made.  \n* Tweets are delivered in reverse-chronological order, in the UTC timezone. This is true within individual pages, as well as across multiple pages:\n* The first Tweet in the first response will be the most recent one matching your query.\n* The last Tweet in the last response will be the oldest one matching your query.  \n* The max\\_results request parameter enables you to configure the number of Tweets returned per response. This defaults to 10 Tweets and has a maximum of 100.  \n* Every pagination implementation will involve parsing next\\_tokens from the response payload, and including them in the 'next page' search request. See below for more details on how to construct these 'next page' requests.  \nThe recent search endpoint was designed to support two fundamental use patterns:  \n* **Get historical** - Requesting matching Tweets from a time period of interest. These are typically one-time requests in support of historical research. Search requests can be based on start\\_time and end\\_time request parameters. recent search endpoint respond with Tweets delivered in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent matching Tweet.  \n* **Polling** - Requesting matching Tweets that have been posted since the last Tweet received. These use cases often have a near-real-time focus and are characterized by frequent requests, \"listening\" for new Tweets of interest. The recent search endpoint provide the since\\_id request parameter in support of the 'polling' pattern. To help with navigating by Tweet IDs, the until\\_id request parameter is also available.  \nNext, we'll discuss the historical mode. This is the default mode of the recent search endpoint and illustrates the fundamentals of pagination. Then we'll discuss examples of polling use cases. When polling triggers pagination, there is an additional step to manage search requests.\n",

Historical requests are typically one-time requests in support of research and analysis.  \nMaking requests for a period of data is the default mode of the recent search endpoint. If a search request does not specify a start\\_time, end\\_time, or since\\_id request parameter, the end\\_time will default to \"now\" (actually 30 seconds before the time of query) and the start\\_time will default to seven days ago.  \nThe endpoint will respond with the first 'page' of Tweets in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent Tweet. The response JSON payload will also include a next\\_token if there are additional pages of data. To collect the entire set of matching Tweets, regardless of the number of pages, requests are made until no next\\_token is provided.  \nFor example, here is an initial request for Tweets with the keyword snow from the last week:  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow  \nThe response includes the most recent 10 Tweets, along with these \"meta\" attributes in the JSON response:  \n\"meta\": {\n\"newest\\_id\": \"1204860593741553664\",\n\"oldest\\_id\": \"1204860580630278147\",\n\"next\\_token\": \"b26v89c19zqg8o3fobd8v73egzbdt3qao235oql\",\n\"result\\_count\": 10\n}  \nTo retrieve the next 10 Tweets, this next\\_token is added to the original request. The request would be:  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&next\\_token=b26v89c19zqg8o3fobd8v73egzbdt3qao235oql  \nThe process of looking for a next\\_token and including it in a subsequent request can be repeated until all (or some number of) Tweets are collected, or until a specified number of requests have been made. If data fidelity (collecting all matches of your query) is key to your use case, a simple \"repeat until request.next\\_token is null\" design will suffice.\n",

Unlike historical use cases, that base requests on time, polling use cases typically base requests on Tweet IDs.  \nCentral to the polling use pattern is that every new Tweet has a [unique ID](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ids) that is 'emitted' from the Twitter platform generally in ascending order. If one Tweet has an ID smaller than another, it means it was posted earlier.  \nThe recent search endpoint support navigating the Tweet archive by Tweet ID. Responses from the endpoint include oldest\\_id and newest\\_id Tweet IDs. In the polling mode, requests are made with the since\\_id set to the largest/newest ID received so far.  \nFor example, say a query for new Tweets about snow is made every five minutes, and the last Tweet we received had a Tweet ID of 10000. When it is time to poll, the request looks like:  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&since\\_id=10000  \nNext, let's say seven Tweets were posted since our last request. Since all of these fit on a single data 'page', there is no next\\_token. The response provides the Tweet ID of the most recent (newest) Tweet:  \n\"meta\": {\n\"newest\\_id\": \"12000\",\n\"oldest\\_id\": \"10005\",\n\"result\\_count\": 7\n}  \nTo make the next polling query, this newest\\_id value is used to set the next since\\_id parameter:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&since_id=12000`  \nWhen there is more data available, and next tokens are provided, only th newest\\_id value from the first page of results is needed. Each page of data will include newest\\_id and oldest\\_id values, but the value provided in the first page is the only one needed for the next, regularly scheduled, polling request. So, If you are implementing a polling design, or searching for Tweets by ID range, pagination logic is slightly more complicated.  \nNow say that there are now 18 more matching Tweets. The endpoint would respond with this initial response with a full data page and a next\\_token for requesting the next page of data from this five minute period. It would also include the newest Tweet ID need for the next polling interval in five minutes.  \n\"meta\": {\n\"newest\\_id\": \"13800\",\n\"oldest\\_id\": \"12500\",\n\"next\\_token\": \"fnsih9chihsnkjbvkjbsc\",\n\"result\\_count\": 10\n}  \nTo collect all the matching data for this five minute period, pass the next\\_token in your next request, along with the same since\\_id value as the previous request.  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&since\\_id=12000&next\\_token=fnsih9chihsnkjbvkjbsc  \n\"meta\": {\n\"newest\\_id\": \"12300\",\n\"oldest\\_id\": \"12010\",\n\"result\\_count\": 8\n}  \nThis second response provides the remaining eight Tweets, and no next\\_token. Note that we do not update our newest\\_id value (12300), and instead base our next since\\_id request on the first response's newest\\_id value:  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&since\\_id=13800\n",

To learn how to generate an App Access Token see this [OAuth 2.0 App-Only guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only).  \nIf you would like to take advantage of the ability to pull private or advertising metrics with the Twitter API v2 endpoint, you will need to use OAuth 1.0a User Context, and pass the user access tokens related to the user who posted the Tweet for which you would like to pull metrics.  \n**Support for Tweet edit history and metadata**  \nBoth versions provide metadata that describes any edit history. Check out the [search API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference) and the [Tweet edits fundamentals page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-edits) for more details.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet id and text fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you will need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in Twitter API v2:  \n| Standard search v1.1 | Search Tweets v2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| q   | query |\n|     | start\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n| until (YYYY-MM-DD) | end\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n| since\\_id | since\\_id |\n| max\\_id | until\\_id |\n| count | max\\_results |\n| Response provides search\\_metadata.next\\_results | next\\_token |  \nThere are also a set of standard search Tweets request parameters **not**\u00a0supported in Twitter API v2:  \n| **Standard v1.1 parameter** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| geocode | Search Tweets at the Basic Access level does not support geo operators. |\n| locale | With standard search, this was used to specify the language of the query but never fully implemented. |\n| lang | Search Tweets endpoints provide a lang query operator for matching on languages of interest. |\n| include\\_entities | Tweet entities are always included. |\n| result\\_type | Search Tweets endpoints deliver all matching Tweets, regardless of engagement level. |\n| extended | Twitter API v2 is built from the ground up to support Tweets with up to 280 characters. With v2, there is no concept of 'extended' Tweets. |  \nHere is an example request that shows the difference between a Standard request and a Search Tweets request:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Standard v1.1** | **Twitter API v2** |\n| https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=snow&count=50 | https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&max\\_results=50 |  \nThese requests will both return the 50 most recent Tweets that contain the keyword snow.\u00a0The v2 request will return the default id and text fields of the matching Tweets. Here is an example of specifying additional Tweet and user fields to include in the JSON payload:  \n|     |\n| --- |\n| **Twitter API v2** |\n| https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=snow&max\\_results=50&tweet.fields=id,created\\_at,author\\_id,text,source,entities,attachments&user.fields=id,name,username,description |  \n#### **\nNew query operators**  \nSearch Tweets introduces new operators in support of two new Twitter API v2 features:  \n* **[Conversation IDs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id)** - As conversations unfold on Twitter, a conservation ID will be available to mark Tweets that are part of the conversation. All Tweets in the conversation will have their conversation\\_id set to the Tweet ID that started it.\n* `conversation_id:`\n* **[Twitter Annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)** provide contextual information about Tweets, and include entity and context annotations. Entities are comprised of people, places, products and organizations. Contexts are domains, or topics, that surfaced entities are a part of. For example, people mentioned in a Tweet may have a context that indicates whether they are an athlete, actor, or politician.\n* context: matches on Tweets that have been annotated with a context of interest.\n* entity: matches on Tweets that have been annotated with an entity of interest.  \n#### AND / OR operator precedence  \nThe basic building block for building search queries is the use of OR and AND logical groupings. The standard search API applies ORs before ANDs, while Search Tweets endpoints (as well as the premium and enterprise versions) applies ANDs before ORs. This difference is critical when translating queries between the two.  \nFor example, with standard search, if you wanted to match Tweets with the keyword \u2018storm\u2019 that mention the word \u2018colorado\u2019 or the #COwx hashtag, you could do that with the following search query:  \nstorm #COwx OR colorado  \nWith the Search Tweets operator precedence, ANDs are applied before ORs. So the above query is equivalent to:  \n(storm #COwx) OR colorado  \nHowever, the above rule would match on any Tweets that mentions \u2018Colorado\u2019, regardless if the Tweet mentions \u2018storm\u2019 or the #COwx hashtag. In addition it would also\u00a0 match Tweets that mentioned both the keyword \u2018storm\u2019 and the #COwx hashtag.  \nTo make the query behave as originally intended, the OR clauses need to be grouped together. The translation of the original standard query to Search Tweets would be:  \nstorm (#COwx OR colorado)  \nThese two rules have very different matching behavior. For the month of October 2019, the original rule matches over 1,175,000 Tweets while the correctly translated rule matches around 5,600 Tweets. Be sure to mind your ANDs and ORs, and use parentheses where needed.\n",

In both cases, you will be using UTC as the timezone when using these parameters.  \n**Support for Tweet edit history and metadata**  \nBoth versions provide metadata that describes any edit history. Check out the [search API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference) and the [Tweet edits fundamentals page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-edits) for more details.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Available time periods  \nBoth the enterprise API and Twitter API v2 offer endpoints that allow you to retrieve filtered Tweet data for the full-archive of Tweets.  \nHowever, the Twitter API v2 does not offer a 30 day time period endpoint like the enterprise API does. Instead it offers the aforementioned full-archive, or a 7 day time period, which align with the Native Enriched to v2 and [Activity Streams to v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/activity-streams-to-v2) which can help you map enterprise fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between the [enterprise response format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/overview) and [Twitter API v2\u2019s format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction) is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the enterprise Search API, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet `id` and `text` fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you will need to use the [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an `includes` object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields, Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including [Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) and [user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a `statuses` array, while Twitter API v2 returns a `data` array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as `contributors` and `user.translator_type` are being removed.\n* Instead of using both `favorites` (in Tweet object) and `favourites` (in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example, `null`) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the Tweet object including the following:  \n* A [conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations) fields, including context and entities\n* Several new [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics) fields\n* A new `reply_setting` field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \nAnd one last note. The premium response includes a `requestParameters` object at the root level, which contains the parameters that you included in your request. The v2 version instead contains a `meta` object that lives at the root level which includes the `newest_id`, `oldest_id`, `result_count`, and `next_token` if there is an additional page of results.  \n#### HTTP methods  \nThe enterprise version of the API allows you to pass the request as either a POST HTTP method with a JSON body, or a GET HTTP method with a query string.  \nV2 only allows you to use the GET HTTP method with a query string.  \n#### Request time formats  \nThe enterprise version of this endpoint uses the following date/time format in both the pagination parameters and the `timePeriod` response field: `YYYYMMDDHHmm`  \nThe v2 endpoint uses ISO 8601/RFC 3339 date/time format in both the pagination parameters and the `start` and `end` response fields: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following is a table of the request parameters for enterprise and Twitter API v2:  \n| Enterprise | Search Tweets v2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| query | query |\n| maxResults | max\\_results |\n| fromDate (YYMMDDHHmm) | start\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n| toDate (YYMMDDHHmm) | end\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n|     | since\\_id |\n|     | until\\_id |\n| next | next\\_token or pagination\\_token |  \n#### Filtering operators  \nWhile the operators between enterprise and Twitter API v2 are mostly the same, there are some differences in operator availability and some new operators that were introduced to just the Twitter API v2 version.  \nTo see a full table of the operators that are available for Twitter API v2, enterprise, and even premium and standard, please visit the [Search Tweets migration landing page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/migrate).\n",

The default time granularity that this endpoint uses is hour, which means if you do not specify the granularity parameter, the endpoint will give you the Tweet counts per hour, for the last 7 days.  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with the [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) authentication methods.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThis variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three: Create a query  \nEach recent Tweet counts request requires a single\u00a0[query](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/integrate/build-a-query). For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Tweets posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from: operator and set it to XDevelopers\u00a0(case insensitive):  \n`from:XDevelopers`  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Tweet IDs separated by a comma, into the \"Value\" column of the `ids` parameter.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |\n| `query` | from:XDevelopers | Query to submit to the recent Tweet counts endpoint |  \n#### Step four (optional): Specify the granularity of the request  \nIf you click the \u2018Send\u2019 button after step three, you will get the default recent Tweet counts: by hour for the last seven days. If you want to get recent Tweet counts by day, you will have to add the granularity parameter with a value of day.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and day into the \"Value\" column of the granularity parameter.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |\n| granularity | day | The granularity for the Tweet counts results. Possible values are day, hour or minute |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/counts/recent?query=from%3AXDevelopers&granularity=day`  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{    \"data\": [        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 0        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 1        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 2        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-19T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 0        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-19T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 0        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-21T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 0        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-21T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 1        },        {            \"end\": \"2021-06-23T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"start\": \"2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z\",            \"tweet_count\": 2        }    ],    \"meta\": {        \"total_tweet_count\": 6    } }`\n",

You can either generate a Bearer Token from directly within a developer App, or generate one using the [POST oauth2/token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference/token) endpoint.  \n####\nDeveloper portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo work with any Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must have a [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview) within that Project. Your keys and tokens within that developer App will work for the recent Tweet counts endpoints. If you would like to use the full-archive Tweet counts endpoint, or utilize the advanced operators and longer query length, you will need to have been approved for enterprise access.  \nPlease visit our section on enterprise access\u00a0to learn more.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the volume, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that every developer can make on behalf of an app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThis endpoint is rate limited at the App-level, meaning that you, the developer, can only make a certain number of requests to this endpoint over a given period of time from any given App (assumed by the credentials that you are using).  \n#### Building queries  \nThe central feature of these endpoints is their use of a single query to filter the Tweets into the counts that deliver to you. These queries are made up of operators that match on Tweet and user attributes, such as message keywords, hashtags, and URLs. Operators can be combined into queries with boolean logic and parentheses to help refine the query's matching behavior.  \nYou can use our guide on [how to build a query](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/integrate/build-a-query) to learn more.  \nWe have also written a more in-depth tutorial on how to [build high-quality filters for getting Twitter data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/building-high-quality-filters).  \n#### Pagination  \nFor recent Tweet counts, there is no next\\_token returned, which means that regardless of the granularity, you will get\u00a0 the Tweet volume for the last 7 days in one API call.  \nFor full-archive Tweet counts, you will get data for the last 30 days. For data more than 30 days, you will get a next\\_token which you can then use to paginate to get the additional data.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/integrate/build-a-query\n\tBuilding queries for Tweet counts\n\tBuilding a query\n\nContent: \n### Building a query  \n#### Query limitations  \nYour queries will be limited depending on which\u00a0[access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level)\u00a0you are using.  \nIf you have Pro access, your query can be 512 characters long.  \nIf you have Enterprise access, please reach out to your account manager.  \n#### Operator availability  \nWhile most operators are available to any developer, there are several that are reserved for those that have been approved for Enterprise access. We list which access level each operator is available to in the\u00a0[list of operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query#list)\u00a0table using the following labels:  \n* Core operators:\u00a0Available when using any\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).\n* Advanced operators:\u00a0Available when using a Project with Enterprise access  \n#### Operator types: standalone and conjunction-required  \n**Standalone operators**\u00a0can be used alone or together with any other operators (including those that require conjunction).  \nFor example, the following query will work because it uses the\u00a0#hashtag\u00a0operator, which is standalone:  \n#twitterapiv2  \n**Conjunction-required**\u00a0operators cannot be used by themselves in a query; they can only be used when at least one standalone operator is included in the query. This is because using these operators alone would be far too general, and would match on an extremely high volume of Tweets.  \nFor example, the following queries are not supported since they contain only conjunction-required operators:  \nhas:media\nhas:links OR is:retweet  \nIf we add in a standalone operator, such as the phrase\u00a0\"twitter data\", the query would then work properly.  \n\"twitter data\" has:mentions (has:media OR has:links)  \n####\nBoolean operators and grouping  \nIf you would like to string together multiple operators in a single query, you have the following tools at your disposal:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **AND logic** | Successive operators with a space between them will result in boolean \"AND\" logic, meaning that Tweets will match only if both conditions are met. For example,\u00a0snow day #NoSchool\u00a0will match Tweets containing the terms snow and day and the hashtag #NoSchool. |\n| **OR logic** | Successive operators with OR between them will result in OR logic, meaning that Tweets will match if either condition is met. For example, specifying\u00a0grumpy OR cat OR #meme\u00a0will match any Tweets containing at least the terms grumpy or cat, or the hashtag #meme. |\n| **NOT logic, negation** | Prepend a dash (-) to a keyword (or any operator) to negate it (NOT). For example,\u00a0cat #meme -grumpy\u00a0will match Tweets containing the hashtag #meme and the term cat, but only if they do not contain the term grumpy. One common query clause is\u00a0\\-is:retweet, which will not match on Retweets, thus matching only on original Tweets, Quote Tweets, and replies. All operators can be negated, but negated operators cannot be used alone. |\n| **Grouping** | You can use parentheses to group operators together. For example,\u00a0(grumpy cat) OR (#meme has:images)\u00a0will return either Tweets containing the terms grumpy and cat, or Tweets with images containing the hashtag #meme. Note that ANDs are applied first, then ORs are applied. |  \n**A note on negations**  \nThe operators\u00a0\\-is:nullcast must always be negated.  \nNegated operators cannot be used alone.  \nDo not negate a set of operators grouped together in a set of parentheses. Instead, negate each individual operator. For example, instead of using skiing -(snow OR day OR noschool), we suggest that you use skiing -snow -day -noschool.  \n####\nOrder of operations  \nWhen combining AND and OR functionality, the following order of operations will dictate how your query is evaluated.  \n1. Operators connected by AND logic are combined first\n2. Then, operators connected with OR logic are applied  \nFor example:  \n* apple OR iphone ipad would be evaluated as apple OR (iphone ipad)\n* ipad iphone OR android would be evaluated as (iphone ipad) OR android  \nTo eliminate uncertainty and ensure that your query is evaluated as intended, group terms together with parentheses where appropriate.  \nFor example:  \n* (apple OR iphone) ipad\n* iphone (ipad OR android)  \n#### Punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity  \nIf you specify a keyword or hashtag query with character accents or diacritics, it will match Tweet text that contains both the term with the accents and diacritics, as well as those terms with normal characters. For example, queries with a keyword\u00a0Diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will match\u00a0_Diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_, as well as with\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e.  \nCharacters with accents or diacritics are treated the same as normal characters and are not treated as word boundaries. For example, a query with the keyword\u00a0cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0would only match activities containing the word\u00a0_cumplea\u00f1os_\u00a0and would not match activities containing\u00a0_cumplea_,\u00a0_cumplean_, or\u00a0_os_.  \nAll operators are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the query\u00a0cat\u00a0will match Tweets with all of the following:\u00a0_cat_,\u00a0_CAT_,\u00a0_Cat_.  \nThe\u00a0[filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream)\u00a0matching behavior acts differently from Tweet counts. When\u00a0[building a filtered stream rule](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule), know that keywords and hashtags that include accents and diacritics will only match on terms that also include the accent and diacritic, and will not match on terms that use normal characters instead.  \nFor example, filtered stream rules that include a keyword\u00a0Diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will only match the terms\u00a0_Diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0and\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_, and will not match on\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e  \n#### Specificity and efficiency  \nWhen you start to build your query, it is important to keep a few things in mind.  \n* Using broad, standalone operators for your query such as a single keyword or #hashtag is generally not recommended since it will likely match on a massive volume of Tweets. Creating a more robust query will result in a more specific set of matching Tweets, and will hopefully increase the accuracy of your Tweet counts to help you find more valuable insights.\n* For example, if your query was just the keyword happy you will likely get anywhere from 200,000 - 300,000 Tweets per day.\n* Adding more conditional operators narrows your results, for example (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet\n* Writing efficient queries is also beneficial for staying within the characters query length restriction. The character count includes the entire query string including spaces and operators.\n* For example, the following query is 59 characters long: (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet  \n####\nQuote Tweet matching behavior  \nWhen using the Tweet counts endpoints, operators will not match on the content from the original Tweet that was quoted, but will match on the content included in the Quote Tweet.  \nHowever, please note that [filtered stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream) will match on both the content from the original Tweet that was quoted and the Quote Tweet's content.  \n#### Iteratively building a query  \n##### Test your query early and often  \nGetting a query to return the \"right\" results the first time is rare. There is so much on Twitter that may or may not be obvious at first and the query syntax described above may be hard to match to your desired query.  \nAs you build a query, it is important for you to periodically test it out using one of the [Search Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search) endpoints to ensure that the Tweets that are matching your query are relevant to your use case.  \nFor this section, we are going to start with the following query and adjust it based on the results that we receive during our test:  \nhappy OR happiness  \n##### Use results to narrow the query  \nAs you test the query with Search Tweets, you should scan the returned Tweets to see if they include the data that you are expecting and hoping to receive. Starting with a broad query and a superset of Tweet matches allows you to review the result and narrow the query to filter out undesired results.  \nWhen we tested the example query, we noticed that we were getting Tweets in a variety of different languages. In this situation, we want to only receive Tweets that are in english, so we\u2019re going to add the lang: operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en  \nThe test delivered a number of Tweets wishing people a happy birthday, so we are going to add \\-birthday as a negated keyword operator. We also want to only receive original Tweets, so we\u2019ve added the negated \\-is:retweet operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for inclusion where needed  \nIf you notice that you are not receiving data via Search Tweets that you expect and know that there are existing Tweets that should return, you may need to broaden your query by removing operators that may be filtering out the desired data.  \nFor our example, we noticed that there were other Tweets in our personal timeline that expressed the emotion that we are looking for and weren\u2019t included in the test results. To ensure we have greater coverage, we are going to add the keywords, excited and elated.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for popular trends/bursts over the time period  \nTrends come and go on Twitter quickly. Maintaining your query should be an active process. If you plan to use a query for a while, we suggest that you periodically check in on the data that you are receiving to see if you need to make any adjustments.  \nIn our example, we notice that we started to receive some Tweets that are wishing people a \u201chappy holidays\u201d. Since we don\u2019t want these Tweets included in our results, we are going to add a negated \\-holidays keyword.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet -holidays  \nOnce you've properly tested and iterated upon your query, you can start sending it with the Tweet counts endpoints to start to receive just the volume of Tweets rather than the full Tweet payloads.\n",

This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.  \nFor example, a Tweet with the text \u201cI like coca-cola\u201d would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.  \nExample: **pepsi OR cola OR \"coca cola\"****emoji**StandaloneCoreMatches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.  \nNote that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.  \nExample: **(\ud83d\ude03 OR \ud83d\ude21) \ud83d\ude2c****\"exact phrase match\"**StandaloneCoreMatches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.  \nExample: **(\"Twitter API\" OR #v2) -\"recent counts\"****#**StandaloneCoreMatches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet.  \nThis operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule **#thanku** will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.  \nExample: **#thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande****@**StandaloneCoreMatches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).  \nExample: **(@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter****$**StandaloneAdvancedMatches any Tweet that contains the specified \u2018cashtag\u2019 (where the leading character of the token is the \u2018$\u2019 character).  \nNote that the cashtag operator relies on Twitter\u2019s \u2018symbols\u2019 entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.  \nExample: **$twtr OR @twitterdev -$fb****from:**StandaloneCoreMatches any Tweet from a specific user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per **from:** operator.  \nExample: **from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitter****to:**StandaloneCoreMatches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per **to:** operator.  \nExample: **to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitter****url:**StandaloneCorePerforms a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.  \nThis operator can matches on the contents of both the **url** or **expanded\\_url** fields. For example, a Tweet containing \"You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4\" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:  \n**from:TwitterDev url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\"\n**(because it will match the contents of **entities.urls.expanded\\_url**)  \n**from:TwitterDev url:\"https://t.co\"\n**(because it will match the contents of **entities.urls.url**)  \nTokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, **url:\"/developer\"**). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, **url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\"**).**retweets\\_of:**StandaloneCoreMatches Tweets that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per **retweets\\_of:** operator.  \nExample: **retweets\\_of:twitterdev OR retweets\\_of:twitterapi****context:**StandaloneCore  \nMatches Tweets with a specific domain id/enitity id pair. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \nYou can only pass a single domain/entity per **context:** operator.  \n**context:domain\\_id.entity\\_id\n**  \nHowever, you can combine multiple domain/entities using the OR operator:  \n`(context:47.1139229372198469633 OR context:11.1088514520308342784)`  \nExamples:\n**context:10.799022225751871488\n**(**domain\\_id.entity\\_id** returns Tweets matching that specific domain-entity pair)  \n**entity:**StandaloneCore  \nMatches Tweets with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \n**Please note** that this is only available with recent search.  \nYou can only pass a single **entity:** operator.  \n**entity:\"string declaration of entity/place\"\n**\nExamples: **entity:\"Michael Jordan\" OR entity:\"Barcelona\"**  \n**conversation\\_id:**StandaloneCoreMatches Tweets that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Tweet ID of a Tweet that started a conversation. As Replies to a Tweet are posted, even Replies to Replies, the **conversation\\_id** is added to its JSON payload.  \nYou can only pass a single conversation ID per **conversation\\_id:** operator.  \nExample: **conversation\\_id:1334987486343299072 (from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi)**list:StandaloneAdvanced  \n**NEW**\u00a0Matches Tweets posted by users who are members of a specified list.  \nFor example, if @twitterdev and @twitterapi were members of List 123, and you included list:123 in your query, your response will only contain Tweets that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the [List lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/lists/lists-lookup) endpoint.  \n**Please note**\u00a0that you can only use a single list: operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per list: operator.  \nExample: list:123  \n**place:**StandaloneAdvancedMatches Tweets tagged with the specified location or Twitter place ID. Multi-word place names (\u201cNew York City\u201d, \u201cPalo Alto\u201d) should be enclosed in quotes.  \nYou can only pass a single place per **place:** operator.  \nNote: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain Twitter place IDs.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: **place:\"new york city\" OR place:seattle OR place:fd70c22040963ac7****place\\_country:**StandaloneAdvancedMatches Tweets where the country code associated with a tagged place/location matches the given ISO alpha-2 character code.  \nYou can find a list of valid ISO codes on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).  \nYou can only pass a single ISO code per **place\\_country:** operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: **place\\_country:US OR place\\_country:MX OR place\\_country:CA****point\\_radius:**StandaloneAdvanced  \nMatches against the **place.geo.coordinates** object of the Tweet when present, and in Twitter, against a place geo polygon, where the Place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.  \n**point\\_radius:\\[longitude latitude radius\\]\n**  \n* Units of radius supported are miles (mi) and kilometers (km)  \n* Radius must be less than 25mi  \n* Longitude is in the range of \u00b1180  \n* Latitude is in the range of \u00b190  \n* All coordinates are in decimal degrees  \n* Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited  \nYou can only pass a single geo polygon per **point\\_radius:** operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: **point\\_radius:\\[2.355128 48.861118 16km\\] OR point\\_radius:\\[-41.287336 174.761070 20mi\\]**  \n**bounding\\_box:**StandaloneAdvancedMatches against the place.geo.coordinates object of the Tweet when present, and in Twitter, against a place geo polygon, where the place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.  \n**bounding\\_box:\\[west\\_long south\\_lat east\\_long north\\_lat\\]\n**  \n* **west\\_long south\\_lat** represent the southwest corner of the bounding box where **west\\_long** is the longitude of that point, and **south\\_lat** is the latitude.  \n* **east\\_long north\\_lat** represent the northeast corner of the bounding box, where **east\\_long** is the longitude of that point, and **north\\_lat** is the latitude.  \n* Width and height of the bounding box must be less than 25mi  \n* Longitude is in the range of \u00b1180  \n* Latitude is in the range of \u00b190  \n* All coordinates are in decimal degrees.  \n* Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited.  \nYou can only pass a single geo polygons per **bounding\\_box:** operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: **bounding\\_box:\\[-105.301758 39.964069 -105.178505 40.09455\\]****is:retweet**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches on Retweets that match the rest of the specified rule. This operator looks only for true Retweets (for example, those generated using the Retweet button). Quote Tweets will not be matched by this operator.  \nExample: **data @twitterdev -is:retweet****is:reply**Conjunction requiredCoreDeliver only explicit replies that match a rule. Can also be negated to exclude replies that match a query from delivery.  \nNote: This operator is also available with the filtered stream endpoint. When used with filtered stream, this operator matches on replies to an original Tweet, replies in quoted Tweets, and replies in Retweets.  \nExample: **from:twitterdev is:reply****is:quote**Conjunction requiredCoreReturns all Quote Tweets, also known as Tweets with comments.  \nExample: **\"sentiment analysis\" is:quote****is:verified**Conjunction requiredCoreDeliver only Tweets whose authors are verified by Twitter.  \nExample: **#nowplaying is:verified****\\-is:nullcast**Conjunction requiredAdvancedRemoves Tweets created for promotion only on ads.twitter.com that have a **\"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers (legacy)\"** or **\"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers\".**\nThis operator must be negated.  \nFor more info on Nullcasted Tweets, see our page on [Tweet availability](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/guides/tweet-availability).  \nExample: **\"mobile games\" -is:nullcast****has:hashtags**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that contain at least one hashtag.  \nExample: **from:twitterdev -has:hashtags****has:cashtags**Conjunction requiredAdvancedMatches Tweets that contain a cashtag symbol (with a leading \u2018$\u2019 character. For example, **$tag**).  \nExample: **#stonks has:cashtags****has:links**Conjunction requiredCoreThis operator matches Tweets which contain links and media in the Tweet body.  \nExample: **from:twitterdev announcement has:links****has:mentions**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that mention another Twitter user.  \nExample: **#nowplaying has:mentions****has:media**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that contain a media object, such as a photo, GIF, or video, as determined by Twitter. This will not match on media created with Periscope, or Tweets with links to other media hosting sites.  \nExample: **(kittens OR puppies) has:media****has:images**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that contain a recognized URL to an image.  \nExample: **#meme has:images****has:videos**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that contain native Twitter videos, uploaded directly to Twitter. This will not match on videos created with Periscope, or Tweets with links to other video hosting sites.  \nExample: **#icebucketchallenge has:videos****has:geo**Conjunction requiredAdvancedMatches Tweets that have Tweet-specific geolocation data provided by the Twitter user. This can be either a location in the form of a Twitter place, with the corresponding display name, geo polygon, and other fields, or in rare cases, a geo lat-long coordinate.  \nNote: Operators matching on place (Tweet geo) will only include matches from original tweets. Retweets do not contain any place data.  \nExample: **recommend #paris has:geo -bakery****lang:**Conjunction requiredCoreMatches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the Tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so AND\u2019ing together multiple languages will yield no results.  \nYou can only pass a single BCP 47 language identifier per **lang:** operator.  \nNote: if no language classification can be made the provided result is \u2018und\u2019 (for undefined).  \nExample: **recommend #paris lang:en**  \nThe list below represents the currently supported languages and their corresponding BCP 47 language identifier:  \n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amharic: **am** | German: **de** | Malayalam: **ml** | Slovak: **sk** |\n| Arabic: **ar** | Greek: **el** | Maldivian: **dv** | Slovenian: **sl** |\n| Armenian: **hy** | Gujarati: **gu** | Marathi: **mr** | Sorani Kurdish: **ckb** |\n| Basque: **eu** | Haitian Creole: **ht** | Nepali: **ne** | Spanish: **es** |\n| Bengali: **bn** | Hebrew: **iw** | Norwegian: **no** | Swedish: **sv** |\n| Bosnian: **bs** | Hindi: **hi** | Oriya: **or** | Tagalog: **tl** |\n| Bulgarian: **bg** | Latinized Hindi: **hi-Latn** | Panjabi: **pa** | Tamil: **ta** |\n| Burmese: **my** | Hungarian: **hu** | Pashto: **ps** | Telugu: **te** |\n| Croatian: **hr** | Icelandic: **is** | Persian: **fa** | Thai: **th** |\n| Catalan: **ca** | Indonesian: **in** | Polish: **pl** | Tibetan: **bo** |\n| Czech: **cs** | Italian: **it** | Portuguese: **pt** | Traditional Chinese: **zh-TW** |\n| Danish: **da** | Japanese: **ja** | Romanian: **ro** | Turkish: **tr** |\n| Dutch: **nl** | Kannada: **kn** | Russian: **ru** | Ukrainian: **uk** |\n| English: **en** | Khmer: **km** | Serbian: **sr** | Urdu: **ur** |\n| Estonian: **et** | Korean: **ko** | Simplified Chinese: **zh-CN** | Uyghur: **ug** |\n| Finnish: **fi** | Lao: **lo** | Sindhi: **sd** | Vietnamese: **vi** |\n| French: **fr** | Latvian: **lv** | Sinhala: **si** | Welsh: **cy** |\n| Georgian: **ka** | Lithuanian: **lt** |     |\n",

All enterprise operators are available to all enterprise users.  \nTwitter API v2  \n* **Core:** These operators are available to any v2 user.\n* **Advanced:** These operators are only available to users that have been approved for Academic Research access.  \nYou can learn more about each of these sets of operators in their respective guides:  \n* [Enterprise operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/search-api/guides/operators)\n* [Twitter API v2 operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query)  \nNow that we understand these different operator levels within Twitter API v2, here is the table that maps out operator availability for Tweet counts (note that if the cell is left blank, the operator is not available):  \n|     | Enterprise | v2  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| keyword | Available | Core |\n| emoji | Available | Core |\n| \u201cexact phrase\u201d | Available | Core |\n| #   | Available | Core |\n| $   | Available | Advanced |\n| @   | Available | Core |\n| from: | Available | Core |\n| to: | Available | Core |\n| url: | Available | Core |\n| retweets\\_of: | Available | Core |\n| context: |     | Core |\n| entity: |     | Core - Only available with recent search |\n| conversation\\_id: |     | Core |\n| place: | Available | Advanced |\n| place\\_country: | Available | Advanced |\n| point\\_radius: | Available | Advanced |\n| bounding\\_box: | Available | Advanced |\n| is:retweet | Available | Core |\n| is:reply | Available | Core |\n| is:quote | Available | Core |\n| is:verified | Available | Core |\n| \\-is:nullcast | Available | Advanced |\n| has:hashtags | Available | Core |\n| has:cashtags | Available | Advanced |\n| has:links | Available | Core |\n| has:mentions | Available | Core |\n| has:media | Available | Core |\n| has:images | Available | Core |\n| has:videos | Available | Core |\n| has:geo | Available | Advanced |\n| lang: | Available | Core |\n| list: |     | Advanced |\n| has:profile\\_geo | Available |     |\n| profile\\_country | Available |     |\n| profile\\_locality | Available |     |\n| profile\\_region | Available |     |\n| proximity | Available |     |\n",

In both cases, you will be using UTC as the timezone when using these parameters.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Available time periods  \nBoth the enterprise API and Twitter API v2 offer endpoints that allow you to retrieve Tweet volume data for the full-archive of Tweets.  \nHowever, the Twitter API v2 does not offer a 30 day time period endpoint like the enterprise API does. Instead it offers the aforementioned full-archive, or a 7 day time period, which align with the [v2 Search Tweets endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search).  \n#### Response data format  \nThere are some slight differences in the data format that you will receive via enterprise and Twitter API v2:  \n* Enterprise\u2019s counts data is located within a `results` object, while the v2 counts data is located within a data object.\n* Enterprise\u2019s counts fields are called `timePeriod` (start time) and `count`, while v2 breaks out the time period into a `start` and `end` field (which use a different date/time format from enterprise explained in request time formats), and renamed the count field to `tweet_count`.\n* The enterprise metadata includes `totalCount`, `next`, and the `requestParameters` object at the root level. Instead,v2 doesn\u2019t include the requestParameters object, and moves/renames the following into a `meta` object that lives at the root level: `total_tweet_count` & `next_token`.  \n#### HTTP methods  \nThe enterprise version of the API allows you to pass the request as either a POST HTTP method with a JSON body, or a GET\u00a0HTTP method with a query string.  \nV2 only allows you to use the GET\u00a0HTTP method with a query string.  \n#### Request time formats  \nThe enterprise version of this endpoint uses the following date/time format in both the pagination parameters and the `timePeriod` response field: `YYYYMMDDHHmm`  \nThe v2 endpoint uses ISO 8601/RFC 3339 date/time format in both the pagination parameters and the `start` and `end` response fields: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`  \n####\nRequest parameters  \nThe following is a table of the request parameters for enterprise and Twitter API v2:  \n| Enterprise | Search Tweets v2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| query | query |\n| bucket | granularity |\n| fromDate (YYMMDDHHmm) | start\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n| toDate (YYMMDDHHmm) | end\\_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) |\n|     | since\\_id |\n|     | until\\_id |\n| next | next\\_token and pagination\\_token |  \n####\nFiltering operators  \nWhile the operators between enterprise and Twitter API v2 are mostly the same, there are some differences in operator availability and some new operators that were introduced to just the Twitter API v2 version.  \nTo see a full table of the operators that are available for Twitter API v2, enterprise, and even premium, please visit the [Tweet counts migration landing page](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/migrate).\n",

You can learn how to build this query by reading our [build a query guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).You can use all available operators and can make queries up to 1,024 characters long. |\n| `end_time`  <br>\u00a0Optional | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with `start_time`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes the first second of the minute). If used without `start_time`, Tweets from 30 days before `end_time` will be returned by default. If not specified, `end_time` will default to \\[now - 30 seconds\\]. |\n| `granularity`  <br>\u00a0Optional | string | This is the granularity that you want the timeseries count data to be grouped by. You can requeset `minute`, `hour`, or `day` granularity. The default granularity, if not specified is `hour`. |\n| `next_token`  <br>\u00a0Optional | string | This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results. The value used with the parameter is pulled directly from the response provided by the API, assuming that your request contains more than 31 days-worth of results, and should not be modified. You can learn more by visiting our page on [pagination](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination). |\n| `since_id`  <br>\u00a0Optional | string | Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (for example, more recent than) the specified ID. The ID specified is exclusive and responses will not include it. If included with the same request as a `start_time` parameter, only `since_id` will be used. |\n| `start_time`  <br>\u00a0Optional | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example, 12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). By default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days ago if you do not include this parameter. |\n| `until_id`  <br>\u00a0Optional | string | Returns results with a Tweet ID less than (that is, older than) the specified ID. Used with `since_id`. The ID specified is exclusive and responses will not include it. |\n",

This endpoint group allows users to listen for specific topics and events in real-time, monitor the conversation around competitions, understand how trends develop in real-time, and much more.  \nDevelopers can use the REST [rules endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules) to add and remove rules to a persistent stream connection without needing to disconnect.\u00a0These\u00a0[rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule)\u00a0can be created with operators that match on Tweet attributes such as message keywords, hashtags, and URLs. Operators and rule clauses can be combined with boolean logic and parentheses to help refine the filter\u2019s matching behavior.  \nOnce you've added a set of rules, you can\u00a0[establish a streaming connection](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-search-stream)\u00a0which will start to deliver\u00a0[Tweet objects](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0in JSON format through a persistent HTTP Streaming connection. You will only receive content matching your rules while connected to the stream.  \nThe filtered search endpoint supports edited Tweets. This endpoint will deliver edited Tweets that match one or more of your filters, along with its edit history, including an array of Tweet IDs. For Tweets with no edit history, this array will hold a single ID. For Tweets that have been edited, this array contains multiple IDs, arranged in ascending order reflecting the order of edits, with the most recent version in the last position of the array. To learn more about how Tweet edits work, see the [Tweet edits fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-edits) page.  \nCertain aspects of the filtered stream endpoint are limited by [access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level):  \n**Pro access**  \n* 1000 rules per stream\n* 100 requests per 15 minutes when using the POST /2/tweets/search/stream/rules endpoint to add rules\n* Can use all operators when building your rule\n* Can build rules up to 1024 characters in length  \n**Enterprise access**  \n* 2500+ rules per stream\n* 450 requests per 15 minutes when using the\u00a0POST\u00a0/2/tweets/search/stream/rules endpoint to add rules\n* Tweets/second delivery cap is set at access level for connections\n* Can use all operators when\u00a0building your rule\n* Can build rules up to 2048 characters in length\n* Can use the\u00a0[recovery and redundancy features](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/recovery-and-redundancy-features)\u00a0to maximize up-time and recover lost data in case of an outage  \nThe returned Tweets from filtered stream count towards the monthly [Tweet cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps).  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=/2/tweets/search/stream&method=get)  \n[Build a dashboard to find insights from Twitter data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/developer-guide--twitter-api-toolkit-for-google-cloud1)\n",

In this guide, we will filter the stream to find Tweets that contain both the keyword \u201ccat\u201d and images. Here is our rule:  \ncat has:images  \n####\nStep two: Add a tag to your rule  \nYou can add multiple concurrent rules to your stream. When you open your streaming connection, Tweets that match any of these rules will flow through the same streaming connection. To ensure that you know which Tweet matches which rule, you can pass a tag along with your rule creation request. Each Tweet that matches that rule will then include a tag field within the Tweet payload noting which rule it matched. For this rule, we are going to assign the following tag:  \ncats with images  \n####\nStep three: Add your rule to the stream  \nThis endpoint requires you to pass an application/JSON body along with this request that contains your rule and its tag. You will also notice that we have included the rule value and tag within an add object since we are trying to add this rule to the stream. This JSON body will look like this:  \n{\n\"add\": \\[\n{\"value\": \"cat has:images\", \"tag\": \"cats with images\"}\n\\]\n}  \nNow that you have fully set up this JSON body, you can add that to a cURL request, which will look like the following. This request isn't ready yet, so please hold off on submitting it until a later step.  \n`curl -X POST 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream/rules' \\ -H \"Content-type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $APP_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -d \\ '{   \"add\": [     {\"value\": \"cat has:images\", \"tag\": \"cats with images\"}   ] }'`  \n####\nStep four: Authenticate your request  \nSince the filtered stream rules endpoints require\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App-Only authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only), you will need to replace $APP\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN\u00a0in the cURL command from step three with the [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) that you generated in the prerequisites.  \n#### Step five:\u00a0Add your rule to the stream  \nNext step is to execute your cURL request, which will add the rule to your stream. Copy and paste the cURL command into your command line interface and press \"return\".  \nIf your cURL request was successful, you\u2019ll receive a response containing data about your value, tag, and id (serves as a unique identifier for your rule). This response will look similar to this:  \n`{ \t\"data\": [{ \t\t\"value\": \"cat has:images\", \t\t\"tag\": \"cats with images\", \t\t\"id\": \"1273026480692322304\" \t}], \t\"meta\": { \t\t\"sent\": \"2020-06-16T22:55:39.356Z\", \t\t\"summary\": { \t\t\t\"created\": 1, \t\t\t\"not_created\": 0, \t\t\t\"valid\": 1, \t\t\t\"invalid\": 0 \t\t} \t} }`  \nYou can validate that your rule was added successfully by sending the following GET request to the rules endpoint, once again making sure to replace $APP\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN with your token. This request will return a full list of all the rules that have been added to your stream.  \n`curl -X GET 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream/rules' \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $APP_ACCESS_TOKEN\"`  \nIf your cURL request was successful, you should receive the following:  \n`{ \t\"data\": [{ \t\t\"id\": \"1273028376882589696\", \t\t\"value\": \"cat has:images\", \t\t\"tag\": \"cats with images\" \t}], \t\"meta\": { \t\t\"sent\": \"2020-06-16T23:14:06.498Z\" \t} }`  \n####\nStep six: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you connect to the stream after step five, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) fields in your response: id\u00a0,\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids. If you would like to receive additional fields beyond these, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a three different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary Tweet objects.  \n2. The associated authors\u2019 [user object\u2019s](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username\n3. The additional\u00a0 user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nTo request these fields, you will need to pass the following in your request:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Key | Value | Returned fields |\n| tweet.fields | created\\_at | tweets.created\\_at |\n| expansions | author\\_id | includes.users.id,\u00a0includes.users.name,\u00a0includes.users.username |\n| user.fields | created\\_at | includes.users.created\\_at |  \nNow that you know this, you can piece together your request URL to connect to the stream, which will look like this:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at`  \n####\nStep seven: Connect to the stream and review your response  \nNow that your rule is in place and you\u2019ve specified which fields you want returned, you\u2019re ready to connect to the stream, which will deliver Tweet objects that match the rule you\u2019ve submitted. This is what the cURL command looks like once you\u2019ve added the URL from step six into your request:  \n`curl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer $APP_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at\"`  \nOnce again, this request must be authenticated using OAuth 2.0 App-Only, so make sure to replace $APP\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN with your credentials before copying and pasting it into your command line tool.  \nOnce you are connected to the filtered stream you will start to receive Tweets that match your rules in the following JSON format:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2022-09-14T19:00:55.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1228393702244134912\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1228393702244134912\"],       \"text\": \"What did the developer write in their Valentine\u2019s card?\\n  \\nwhile(true) {\\n    I = Love(You);  \\n}\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2022-09-12T17:09:56.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1227640996038684673\",        \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1227640996038684673\"],       \"text\": \"Doctors: Googling stuff online does not make you a doctor\\n\\nDevelopers: https://t.co/mrju5ypPkb\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2022-09-27T20:26:41.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1199786642791452673\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1199786642791452673\"],       \"text\": \"C#\"     }   ],   \"includes\": {     \"users\": [       {         \"created_at\": \"2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z\",         \"id\": \"2244994945\",         \"name\": \"Twitter Dev\",         \"username\": \"TwitterDev\"       }     ]   } }`  \nIf you would like to close your connection, you can press Control-C in your command line tool on either Mac or Windows systems to break the connection, or you can also close the window.\n",

We list which [access level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level) each operator is available to in the [list of operators](#list) table using the following labels:  \n* **Essential operators:**\u00a0Available when using any access level.\n* **Elevated operators:** Available when using a Project with Pro, or Enterprise access.  \n#### Operator types: standalone and conjunction-required  \n**Standalone operators** can be used alone or together with any other operators (including those that require conjunction).  \nFor example, the following rule will work because it uses the #hashtag operator, which is standalone:  \n#twitterapiv2  \n**Conjunction required** operators cannot be used by themselves in a rule; they can only be used when at least one standalone operator is included in the rule. This is because using these operators alone would be far too general, and would match on an extremely high volume of Tweets.  \nFor example, the following rules are not supported since they contain only conjunction required operators:  \nhas:media\nhas:links OR is:retweet  \nIf we add in a standalone operator, such as the phrase \"twitter data\", the rule would then work properly.  \n\"twitter data\" has:mentions (has:media OR has:links)  \n####\nBoolean operators and grouping  \nIf you would like to string together multiple operators in a single rule, you have the following tools at your disposal:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **AND logic** | Successive operators **with a space between them** will result in boolean \"AND\" logic, meaning that Tweets will match only if both conditions are met. For example, snow day #NoSchool will match Tweets containing the terms snow and day and the hashtag #NoSchool. |\n| **OR logic** | Successive operators with OR between them will result in OR logic, meaning that Tweets will match if either condition is met. For example, specifying grumpy OR cat OR #meme will match any Tweets containing at least the terms grumpy or cat, or the hashtag #meme. |\n| **NOT logic, negation** | Prepend a dash (-) to a keyword (or any operator) to negate it (NOT). For example, cat #meme -grumpy will match Tweets containing the hashtag #meme and the term cat, but only if they do not contain the term grumpy. One common rule clause is \\-is:retweet, which will not match on Retweets, thus matching only on original Tweets, Quote Tweets, and replies. All operators can be negated, but negated operators cannot be used alone. |\n| **Grouping** | You can use parentheses to group operators together. For example, (grumpy cat) OR (#meme has:images) will return either Tweets containing the terms grumpy and cat, or Tweets with images containing the hashtag #meme. Note that ANDs are applied first, then ORs are applied. |  \n**A note on negations**  \nAll operators can be negated except for sample:, and \\-is:nullcast must always be negated. Negated operators cannot be used alone.  \nDo not negate a set of operators grouped together in a set of parentheses. Instead, negate each individual operator.  \nFor example, instead of using skiing -(snow OR day OR noschool), we suggest that you use skiing -snow -day -noschool.  \n####\nOrder of operations  \nWhen combining AND and OR functionality, the following order of operations will dictate how your rule is evaluated.  \n1. Operators connected by AND logic are combined first\n2. Then, operators connected with OR logic are applied  \nFor example:  \n* apple OR iphone ipad would be evaluated as apple OR (iphone ipad)\n* ipad iphone OR android would be evaluated as (iphone ipad) OR android  \nTo eliminate uncertainty and ensure that your rule is evaluated as intended, group terms together with parentheses where appropriate.  \nFor example:  \n* (apple OR iphone) ipad\n* iphone (ipad OR android)  \n#### Punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity  \nIf you specify a keyword or hashtag rule with character accents or diacritics, it will match Tweets that contain the exact word with proper accents or diacritics, but not those that have the proper letters, but without the accent or diacritic.  \nFor example, rules with the keyword\u00a0diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will match Tweets that contain\u00a0_diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_\u00a0because they include the accent or diacritic. However, these rules will not match Tweets that contain\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e.  \nCharacters with accents or diacritics are treated the same as normal characters and are not treated as word boundaries. For example, a rule with the keyword\u00a0_cumplea\u00f1os_\u00a0would only match Tweets containing the word\u00a0_cumplea\u00f1os_\u00a0and would not match Tweets containing\u00a0_cumplea_,\u00a0_cumplean_, or\u00a0_os_.  \nAll operators are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the rule cat will match all of the following:\u00a0_cat_,\u00a0_CAT_,\u00a0_Cat_.  \nThe\u00a0[Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search)\u00a0matching behavior acts differently from filtered stream. When\u00a0[building a Search Tweets query](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-rule), know that keywords and hashtags that include accents or diacritics will match both the term with the accents and diacritics, as well as with normal characters.  \nFor example, Search Tweets queries that include a keyword\u00a0Diacr\u00edtica\u00a0or hashtag\u00a0#cumplea\u00f1os\u00a0will match both\u00a0_Diacr\u00edtica_\u00a0and\u00a0_#cumplea\u00f1os_, as well as\u00a0_Diacritica_\u00a0or\u00a0_#cumpleanos_\u00a0without the tilde \u00ed or e\u00f1e.  \n#### Specificity and efficiency  \nWhen you start to build your rule, it is important to keep a few things in mind.  \n* Using broad, standalone operators for your rule such as a single keyword or #hashtag is generally not recommended since it will likely match on a massive volume of Tweets. Creating a more robust rule will result in a more specific set of matching Tweets, and will hopefully reduce the amount of noise in the payload that you will need to sift through to find valuable insights.\n* For example, if your rule was just the keyword happy you will likely get anywhere from 200,000 - 300,000 Tweets per day.\n* Adding more conditional operators narrows your search results, for example (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet\n* Writing efficient rules is also beneficial for staying within the characters rule length restriction. The character count includes the entire rule string including spaces and operators.\n* For example, the following rule is 59 characters long: (happy OR happiness) place\\_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet  \n####\nQuote Tweet matching behavior  \nWhen using the filtered stream endpoints, operators will match on both the content from the original Tweet that was quoted, as well as the content included in the Quote Tweet.  \nHowever, please note that the [Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search) endpoints\u00a0will not match on the content from the original Tweet that was quoted, but will match on the Quote Tweet's content.  \n#### Iteratively building a rule  \n##### Test your rule early and often  \nGetting a rule to return the \"right\" results the first time is rare. There is so much on Twitter that may or may not be obvious at first and the rule syntax described above may be hard to match to your desired search. As you build a rule, it is important for you to periodically test it out with the stream endpoint to see what data it returns. You can also test with one of the [Search Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search) endpoints, assuming the operators that you are using are also available via that endpoint.  \nFor this section, we are going to start with the following rule and adjust it based on the results that we receive during our test:  \nhappy OR happiness  \n##### Use results to narrow the rule  \nAs you test the rule, you should scan the returned Tweets to see if they include the data that you are expecting and hoping to receive. Starting with a broad rule and a superset of Tweet matches allows you to review the result and narrow the rule to filter out undesired results.  \nWhen we tested the example rule, we noticed that we were getting Tweets in a variety of different languages. In this situation, we want to only receive Tweets that are in english, so we\u2019re going to add the lang: operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en  \nThe test delivered a number of Tweets wishing people a happy birthday, so we are going to add \\-birthday as a negated keyword operator. We also want to only receive original Tweets, so we\u2019ve added the negated \\-is:retweet operator:  \n(happy OR happiness) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for inclusion where needed  \nIf you notice that you are not receiving data that you expect and know that there are existing Tweets that should return, you may need to broaden your rule by removing operators that may be filtering out the desired data.  \nFor our example, we noticed that there were other Tweets in our personal timeline that expressed the emotion that we are looking for and weren\u2019t included in the test results. To ensure we have greater coverage, we are going to add the keywords, excited and elated.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet  \n##### Adjust for popular trends/bursts over the time period  \nTrends come and go on Twitter quickly. Maintaining your rule should be an active process. If you plan to use a single rule for a while, we suggest that you periodically check in on the data that you are receiving to see if you need to make any adjustments.  \nIn our example, we notice that we started to receive some Tweets that are wishing people a \u201chappy holidays\u201d. Since we don\u2019t want these Tweets included in our results, we are going to add a negated \\-holidays keyword.  \n(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet -holidays  \n#### Adding and removing rules  \nYou will be using the\u00a0[POST /2/tweets/search/stream/rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules)\u00a0endpoint when both adding and deleting rules from your stream.  \nTo add one or more rule to your stream, submit an\u00a0add\u00a0JSON body with an array that contains the value parameter including the rule, and the optional\u00a0tag\u00a0parameter including free-form text that you can use to\u00a0[identify which returned Tweets match this rule](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/matching-returned-tweets).  \nFor example, if you were trying to add a set of rules to your stream, your cURL command might look like this:  \n`curl -X POST 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream/rules' \\ -H \"Content-type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" -d \\ '{   \"add\": [     {\"value\": \"cat has:media\", \"tag\": \"cats with media\"},     {\"value\": \"cat has:media -grumpy\", \"tag\": \"happy cats with media\"},     {\"value\": \"meme\", \"tag\": \"funny things\"},     {\"value\": \"meme has:images\"}   ] }'`  \nSimilarly, to remove one or more rules from your stream, submit a\u00a0delete\u00a0JSON body with the array of that contains the\u00a0id\u00a0parameter including the rule IDs that you would like to delete.  \nFor example, if you were trying to remove a set of rules from your stream, your cURL command might look like this:  \n`curl -X POST 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream/rules' \\   -H \"Content-type: application/json\" \\   -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" -d \\   '{     \"delete\": {       \"ids\": [         \"1165037377523306498\",         \"1165037377523306499\"       ]     }   }'`  \nWe have sample code in different languages available via our\u00a0[Github](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/tree/master/Filtered-Stream).  \n#### Rule examples  \n##### Tracking a natural disaster  \nThe following rule matched on Tweets coming from weather agencies and gauges that discuss Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017. Notice the use of the\u00a0[matching rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/matching-returned-tweets)\u00a0tag, and the JSON format that you will need to use when submitting the rule to the\u00a0[POST /2/tweets/search/stream/rules endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules).  \n`{             \"value\": \"-is:retweet has:geo (from:NWSNHC OR from:NHC_Atlantic OR from:NWSHouston OR from:NWSSanAntonio OR from:USGS_TexasRain OR from:USGS_TexasFlood OR from:JeffLindner1)\",             \"tag\": \"theme:info has:geo original from weather agencies and gauges\"         }`  \n##### Reviewing the sentiment of a conversation  \nThe next rule could be used to better understand the sentiment of the conversation developing around the hashtag,\u00a0_#nowplaying_, but only from Tweets published within North America.  \n`{             \"value\": \"#nowplaying (happy OR exciting OR excited OR favorite OR fav OR amazing OR lovely OR incredible) (place_country:US OR place_country:MX OR place_country:CA) -horrible -worst -sucks -bad -disappointing\",             \"tag\": \"#nowplaying positive\"         },         {             \"value\": \"#nowplaying (horrible OR worst OR sucks OR bad OR disappointing) (place_country:US OR place_country:MX OR place_country:CA) -happy -exciting -excited -favorite -fav -amazing -lovely -incredible\",             \"tag\": \"#nowplaying negative\"         }`  \n##### Find Tweets that relate to a specific Tweet annotation  \nThis rule was built to search for original Tweets that included an image of a pet that is not a cat, where the language identified in the Tweet is Japanese. To do this, we used the\u00a0context:\u00a0operator to take advantage of the\u00a0[Tweet annotation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0functionality. We first used the\u00a0[Tweet lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup)\u00a0endpoint and the\u00a0tweet.fields=context\\_annotations\u00a0fields parameter to identify which domain.entity IDs we need to use in our query:  \n* Tweets that relate to cats return\u00a0**domain**\u00a066 (Interests and Hobbies category) with\u00a0entity\u00a0852262932607926273 (Cats).\n* Tweets that relate to pets return\u00a0**domain**\u00a065 (Interests and Hobbies Vertical) with\u00a0entity\u00a0852262932607926273 (Pets).  \nHere is what the rule would look like:  \n`        {             \"value\": \"context:65.852262932607926273 -context:66.852262932607926273 -is:retweet has:images lang:ja\",             \"tag\": \"Japanese pets with images - no cats\"         }`\n",

This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.  \nFor example, a Tweet with the text \u201cI like coca-cola\u201d would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your rule. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.  \nExample: pepsi OR cola OR \"coca cola\"emojiStandaloneEssentialMatches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.  \nNote that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a rule.  \nExample: (\ud83d\ude03 OR \ud83d\ude21) \ud83d\ude2c\"exact phrase match\"StandaloneEssentialMatches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.  \nExample: (\"Twitter API\" OR #v2) -\"filtered stream\"#StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet.  \nThis operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule #thanku will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.  \nExample: #thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande@StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).  \nExample: (@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter$StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that contains the specified \u2018cashtag\u2019 (where the leading character of the token is the \u2018$\u2019 character).  \nNote that the cashtag operator relies on Twitter\u2019s \u2018symbols\u2019 entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.  \nExample: $twtr OR @twitterdev -$fbfrom:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet from a specific user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID from: operator.  \nExample: from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitterto:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user.\nThe value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per to: operator.  \nExample: to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitterurl:StandaloneEssentialPerforms a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.  \nThis operator can matches on the contents of both the url or expanded\\_url fields. For example, a Tweet containing \"You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4\" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:  \nfrom:TwitterDev url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\"\n(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.expanded\\_url)  \nfrom:TwitterDev url:\"https://t.co\"\n(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.url)  \nTokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, url:\"/developer\"). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, url:\"https://developer.twitter.com\").  \nYou can only pass a single URL per url: operator.retweets\\_of:StandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_ retweets\\_of\\_user:  \nMatches Tweets that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user\u2019s numeric user ID.  \nYou can only pass a single username/ID per retweets\\_of: operator.  \nExample: retweets\\_of:twitterdev OR retweets\\_of:twitterapi  \nSee\u00a0[HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup)\u00a0for methods for looking up numeric Twitter Account IDs.  \ncontext:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets with a specific domain id and/or domain id, enitity id pair where \\* represents a wildcard. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [Tweet\u00a0annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \nYou can only pass a single domain/entitie per context: operator.  \ncontext:domain\\_id.entity\\_id\ncontext:domain\\_id.\\*\ncontext:\\*.entity\\_id  \nExamples:\ncontext:10.799022225751871488\n(domain\\_id.entity\\_id returns Tweets matching that specific domain-entity pair)  \ncontext:47.\\*\n(domain\\_id.\\* returns Tweets matching that domain ID, with any domain-entity pair)  \ncontext:\\*.799022225751871488\n(\\*.entity\\_id returns Tweets matching that entity ID, with any domain-entity pair)entity:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations).  \nYou can only pass a single entity per entity: operator.  \nentity:\"string declaration of entity/place\"  \nExamples: entity:\"Michael Jordan\" OR entity:\"Barcelona\"conversation\\_id:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Tweet ID of a Tweet that started a conversation. As Replies to a Tweet are posted, even Replies to Replies, the conversation\\_id is added to its JSON payload.  \nYou can only pass a single conversation ID per conversation\\_id: operator.  \nExample: conversation\\_id:1334987486343299072 (from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi)  \nbio:  \nStandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0user\\_bio:  \nMatches a keyword or phrase within the Tweet publisher's bio. This is a tokenized match within the contents of the description field within the [User object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user).  \nExample: bio:developer OR bio:\"data engineer\" OR bio:academic  \nbio\\_name:StandaloneEssentialMatches a keyword within the Tweet publisher's user bio name. This is a tokenized match within the contents of a user\u2019s \u201cname\u201d field within the [User object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user).  \nExample: bio\\_name:phd OR bio\\_name:md  \nbio\\_location:  \nStandaloneEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0user\\_bio\\_location:  \nMatches Tweets that are published by users whose location contains the specified keyword or phrase. This operator performs a tokenized match, similar to the normal keyword rules on the message body.  \nThis location is part of the [User object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/operators), matches on the 'location' field, and is a non-normalized, user-generated, free-form string. It is also different from a Tweet's location (see place:).  \nExample: bio\\_location:\"big apple\" OR bio\\_location:nyc OR bio\\_location:manhattan  \nplace:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets tagged with the specified location or Twitter place ID. Multi-word place names (\u201cNew York City\u201d, \u201cPalo Alto\u201d) should be enclosed in quotes.  \nYou can only pass a single place per place: operator.  \nNote: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain Twitter place IDs.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: place:\"new york city\" OR place:seattle OR place:fd70c22040963ac7place\\_country:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets where the country code associated with a tagged place/location matches the given ISO alpha-2 character code.  \nYou can find a list of valid ISO codes on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).  \nYou can only pass a single ISO code per place\\_country: operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: place\\_country:US OR place\\_country:MX OR place\\_country:CApoint\\_radius:StandaloneElevated  \nMatches against the place.geo.coordinates object of the Tweet when present, and in Twitter, against a place geo polygon, where the Place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.  \npoint\\_radius:\\[longitude latitude radius\\]  \n* Units of radius supported are miles (mi) and kilometers (km)  \n* Radius must be less than 25mi  \n* Longitude is in the range of \u00b1180  \n* Latitude is in the range of \u00b190  \n* All coordinates are in decimal degrees  \n* Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited  \nYou can only pass a single geo polygon per point\\_radius: operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: point\\_radius:\\[2.355128 48.861118 16km\\] OR point\\_radius:\\[-41.287336 174.761070 20mi\\]  \nbounding\\_box:  \nStandaloneElevated  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0geo\\_bounding\\_box:  \nMatches against the place.geo.coordinates object of the Tweet when present, and in Twitter, against a place geo polygon, where the place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.  \nbounding\\_box:\\[west\\_long south\\_lat east\\_long north\\_lat\\]  \n* west\\_long south\\_lat represent the southwest corner of the bounding box where west\\_long is the longitude of that point, and south\\_lat is the latitude.  \n* east\\_long north\\_lat represent the northeast corner of the bounding box, where east\\_long is the longitude of that point, and north\\_lat is the latitude.  \n* Width and height of the bounding box must be less than 25mi  \n* Longitude is in the range of \u00b1180  \n* Latitude is in the range of \u00b190  \n* All coordinates are in decimal degrees.  \n* Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited.  \nYou can only pass a single geo polygons per bounding\\_box: operator.  \nNote: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  \nExample: bounding\\_box:\\[-105.301758 39.964069 -105.178505 40.09455\\]  \nis:retweetConjunction requiredEssentialMatches on Retweets that match the rest of the specified rule. This operator looks only for true Retweets (for example, those generated using the Retweet button). Quote Tweets will not be matched by this operator.  \nExample: data @twitterdev -is:retweetis:replyConjunction requiredEssentialDeliver only explicit replies that match a rule. Can also be negated to exclude replies that match a rule from delivery.  \nWhen used with the filtered stream, this operator matches on replies to an original Tweet, replies in quoted Tweets and replies in Retweets.  \nExample: from:twitterdev is:replyis:quoteConjunction requiredEssentialReturns all Quote Tweets, also known as Tweets with comments.  \nExample: \"sentiment analysis\" is:quoteis:verifiedConjunction requiredEssentialDeliver only Tweets whose authors are verified by Twitter.  \nExample: #nowplaying is:verified\\-is:nullcastConjunction requiredElevatedRemoves Tweets created for promotion only on ads.twitter.com that have a \"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers (legacy)\" or \"source\":\"Twitter for Advertisers\".\nThis operator must be negated.  \nFor more info on Nullcasted Tweets, see our page on [Tweet availability](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/guides/tweet-availability).  \nExample: \"mobile games\" -is:nullcasthas:hashtagsConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that contain at least one hashtag.  \nExample: from:twitterdev -has:hashtagshas:cashtagsConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that contain a cashtag symbol (with a leading \u2018$\u2019 character. For example, $tag).  \nExample: #stonks has:cashtagshas:linksConjunction requiredEssentialThis operator matches Tweets which contain links and media in the Tweet body.  \nExample: from:twitterdev announcement has:linkshas:mentionsConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that mention another Twitter user.  \nExample: #nowplaying has:mentions  \nhas:media  \nConjunction requiredEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0has:media\\_link  \nMatches Tweets that contain a media object, such as a photo, GIF, or video, as determined by Twitter. This will not match on media created with Periscope, or Tweets with links to other media hosting sites.  \nExample: (kittens OR puppies) has:media  \nhas:imagesConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that contain a recognized URL to an image.  \nExample: #meme has:images  \nhas:video\\_link  \nConjunction requiredEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0has:videos  \nMatches Tweets that contain native Twitter videos, uploaded directly to Twitter. This will not match on videos created with Periscope, or Tweets with links to other video hosting sites.  \nExample: #icebucketchallenge has:video\\_link  \nhas:geoConjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that have Tweet-specific geolocation data provided by the Twitter user. This can be either a location in the form of a Twitter place, with the corresponding display name, geo polygon, and other fields, or in rare cases, a geo lat-long coordinate.  \nNote: Operators matching on place (Tweet geo) will only include matches from original tweets. Retweets do not contain any place data.  \nExample: recommend #paris has:geo -bakerysample:Conjunction requiredEssentialReturns a random percent sample of Tweets that match a rule rather than the entire set of Tweets. The percent value must be represented by an integer between 1 and 100 (for example, sample:10 will return a random 10% sample).  \nThis operator first reduces the scope of the stream to the percentage you specified, then the rule/filter is applied to that sampled subset. In other words, if you are using, for example, sample:10, each Tweet will have a 10% chance of being in the sample.  \nThis operator applies to the entire rule and requires all OR'd terms to be grouped.  \nExample: #nowplaying @spotify sample:15lang:Conjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so AND\u2019ing together multiple languages will yield no results.  \nYou can only pass a single BCP 47 language identifier per lang: operator.  \nNote: if no language classification can be made the provided result is \u2018und\u2019 (for undefined).  \nExample: recommend #paris lang:en  \nThe list below represents the currently supported languages and their corresponding BCP 47 language identifier:  \n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amharic: am | German: de | Malayalam: ml | Slovak: sk |\n| Arabic: ar | Greek: el | Maldivian: dv | Slovenian: sl |\n| Armenian: hy | Gujarati: gu | Marathi: mr | Sorani Kurdish: ckb |\n| Basque: eu | Haitian Creole: ht | Nepali: ne | Spanish: es |\n| Bengali: bn | Hebrew: iw | Norwegian: no | Swedish: sv |\n| Bosnian: bs | Hindi: hi | Oriya: or | Tagalog: tl |\n| Bulgarian: bg | Latinized Hindi: hi-Latn | Panjabi: pa | Tamil: ta |\n| Burmese: my | Hungarian: hu | Pashto: ps | Telugu: te |\n| Croatian: hr | Icelandic: is | Persian: fa | Thai: th |\n| Catalan: ca | Indonesian: in | Polish: pl | Tibetan: bo |\n| Czech: cs | Italian: it | Portuguese: pt | Traditional Chinese: zh-TW |\n| Danish: da | Japanese: ja | Romanian: ro | Turkish: tr |\n| Dutch: nl | Kannada: kn | Russian: ru | Ukrainian: uk |\n| English: en | Khmer: km | Serbian: sr | Urdu: ur |\n| Estonian: et | Korean: ko | Simplified Chinese: zh-CN | Uyghur: ug |\n| Finnish: fi | Lao: lo | Sindhi: sd | Vietnamese: vi |\n| French: fr | Latvian: lv | Sinhala: si | Welsh: cy |\n| Georgian: ka | Lithuanian: lt |     |  \nfollowers\\_count:\u00a0Essential  \nMatches Tweets when the author has a followers count within the given range.  \nIf a single number is specified, any number equal to or higher will match.  \nExample: followers\\_count:500  \nAdditionally, a range can be specified to match any number in the given range.  \nExample: followers\\_count:1000..10000  \ntweets\\_count:  \nEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0statuses\\_count:  \nMatches Tweets when the author has posted a number of Tweets that falls within the given range.  \nIf a single number is specified, any number equal to or higher will match.  \nExample: tweets\\_count:1000  \nAdditionally, a range can be specified to match any number in the given range.  \nExample: tweets\\_count:1000..10000  \nfollowing\\_count:  \nEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0friends\\_count:  \nMatches Tweets when the author has a friends count (the number of users they follow) that falls within the given range.  \nIf a single number is specified, any number equal to or higher will match.  \nExample: following\\_count:500  \nAdditionally, a range can be specified to match any number in the given range.  \nExample: following\\_count:1000..10000  \nlisted\\_count:  \nEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0user\\_in\\_lists\\_count:  \nMatches Tweets when the author is included in the specified number of Lists.  \nIf a single number is specified, any number equal to or higher will match.  \nExample: listed\\_count:10  \nAdditionally, a range can be specified to match any number in the given range.  \nExample: listed\\_count:10..100  \nurl\\_title:  \nEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0within\\_url\\_title:  \nPerforms a keyword/phrase match on the expanded URL HTML title metadata.  \nExample: url\\_title:snow  \nurl\\_description:  \nEssential  \n_Available alias:_\u00a0within\\_url\\_description:  \nPerforms a keyword/phrase match on the expanded page description metadata.  \nExample: url\\_description:weather  \nurl\\_contains:\u00a0Essential  \nMatches Tweets with URLs that literally contain the given phrase or keyword.

Inspect the error message returned by the stream to understand the reason for the failure. Possible reasons for disconnections are as follows:  \n* An authentication error (such as a wrong token or a wrong authentication method being used).\n* A streaming server is restarted on the Twitter side. This is usually related to a code deploy and should be generally expected and designed around.\n* Your client is not keeping up with the volume of Tweets the stream is delivering or is reading data too slowly. Every streaming connection is backed by a queue of messages to be sent to the client. If this queue grows too large over time, the connection will be closed.\n* Your account exceeded your daily/monthly quota of Tweets.\n* You have too many active redundant connections.\n* A client stops reading data suddenly. If the rate of Tweets being read off of the stream drops suddenly, the connection will be closed.\n* Possible networking issues between server and client\n* A temporary server side issue, scheduled maintenance and updates. (Check the\u00a0[status page](https://api.twitterstat.us/))  \n#### Common disconnection errors include:  \n`{ \t\"errors\": [{ \t\t\"title\": \"operational-disconnect\", \t\t\"disconnect_type\": \"UpstreamOperationalDisconnect\", \t\t\"detail\": \"This stream has been disconnected upstream for operational reasons.\", \t\t\"type\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/operational-disconnect\" \t}] }`  \n` { \t\"title\": \"ConnectionException\", \t\"detail\": \"This stream is currently at the maximum allowed connection limit.\", \t\"connection_issue\": \"TooManyConnections\", \t\"type\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/streaming-connection\" }`\n",

The endpoint provides a 20-second keep alive heartbeat (it will look like a new line character). Use this signal to detect if you\u2019re being disconnected.  \n1. Your code should detect when fresh content and the heartbeat stop arriving.\n2. If that happens, your code should trigger a reconnection logic. Some clients and languages allow you to specify a read timeout, which you can set to 20 seconds.\n3. Your service should detect these disconnections and reconnect as soon as possible.  \nOnce an established connection drops, attempt to reconnect immediately. If the reconnect fails, slow down your reconnect attempts according to the type of error experienced:  \n* Back off linearly for TCP/IP level network errors. These problems are generally temporary and tend to clear quickly. Increase the delay in reconnects by 250ms each attempt, up to 16 seconds.\n* Back off exponentially for HTTP errors for which reconnecting would be appropriate. Start with a 5 second wait, doubling each attempt, up to 320 seconds.\n* Back off exponentially for HTTP 429 errors Rate limit exceeded. Start with a 1 minute wait and double each attempt. Note that every HTTP 429 received increases the time you must wait until rate limiting will no longer be in effect for your account.\n",

This is useful to understand how many times you can use the rule endpoint, and how many reconnections attempts are allowed for the streaming endpoint.  \n* x-rate-limit-limit indicates the number of allotted requests your client is allowed to make during the 15-minute window.  \n* x-rate-limit-remaining indicates the number of requests made so far in the 15-minute window.  \n* x-rate-limit-reset is a UNIX timestamp indicating when the 15-minute window will restart, resetting x-rate-limit-remaining to 0.  \nThe filter stream endpoint does not currently report usage data. To check how many Tweets have been delivered, your code can implement a metering logic, so that consumption can be measured and paused if needed.  \nYour code that hosts the client side of the stream simply inserts incoming Tweets into a first in, first out (FIFO) queue, or a similar memory structure; a separate process/thread should consume Tweets from that queue to parse and prepare content for storage. With this design, you can implement a service that can scale efficiently in case incoming Tweet volumes changes dramatically. Conceptually, you can think of it as downloading an infinitely long file over HTTP.\n",

Some stacks will cache a resolved address for the duration of the process and will not pick up DNS changes within the prescribed TTL. Such aggressive caching will lead to service disruptions on your client as Twitter shifts load between IP addresses.  \n#### User Agent  \nEnsure your user-agent HTTP header includes the client\u2019s version. This will be critical in diagnosing issues on Twitter\u2019s end. If your environment precludes setting the user-agent field, then set an x-user-agent header.\n",

Sometimes these events are known about in advance, like the Super Bowl, political elections, and New Year\u2019s celebrations around the world. Other times, the spikes in volume are due to unexpected happenings such as natural disasters, unplanned political events, pop culture moments, or health pandemics like COVID-19.  \nThese bursts of user activity may sometimes be short-lived (measured in seconds), or they may even be sustained over several minutes\u2019 time. No matter their origin, it is important to consider the impact that they can have on applications consuming real-time data from Twitter. Here are some best practices that will help your team prepare for high-volume social data events.  \n#### Review your current filtered stream rules  \n* Certain keywords can skyrocket during high volume events, such as brand mentions when a brand sponsors a major sporting event.\n* Be careful to avoid any unnecessary or overly generic rules that may generate unnecessary activity volumes.\n* Consider communicating with your clients prior to known high-volume events to help them plan appropriately.  \n#### Stress test your application  \nAnticipate that burst volumes may reach 5-10x average daily consumption levels. Depending on your rule set, the increase may be much higher.  \n#### Understand delivery caps for connections  \nFlow and delivery caps are based on levels of access. This results in a static volume of delivered results for streams.  \n* **Academic**: 250 Tweets/second\n* **Enterprise**: Tweets/second is set at access level  \n#### Optimize to stay connected  \nWith real-time streams, staying connected is essential to avoid missing data. Your client application should be able to detect a disconnect and have logic to immediately retry its connection, using an exponential backoff if the reconnect attempt fails.  \n#### Add built-in buffering on your end  \nBuilding a multi-threaded application is a key strategy for handling high-volume streams. At a high-level, a best practice for managing data streams is to have a separate thread/process that establishes the streaming connection and then writes received JSON activities to a memory structure or a buffered stream reader. This \u2018light-weight\u2019 stream processing thread is responsible for handling incoming data, which can be buffered in memory, growing and shrinking as needed. Then a different thread consumes that hash and does the \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 of parsing the JSON, preparing database writes, or whatever else your application needs to do.  \n#### Global events = global time zones  \nThe events may occur after business hours or over the weekend, so be sure that your team is prepared for spikes to occur outside your normal business hours.\n",

Establish an HTTPS streaming connection to the filter stream endpoint.\n2. Asynchronously send POST requests to the filter stream rules endpoint to add and delete rules from the stream.\n3. Handle low data volumes \u2013 Maintain the streaming connection, detecting Tweet objects and keep-alive signals\n4. Handle high data volumes \u2013 de-couple stream ingestion from additional processing using asynchronous processes,\u00a0and ensure client side buffers are flushed regularly.\n5. Manage volume consumption tracking on the client side.\n6. Detect stream disconnections, evaluate and reconnect to the stream automatically.  \n#### Connecting to a streaming endpoint  \nEstablishing a connection to Twitter API v2 streaming endpoints means making a very long lived HTTP request, and parsing the response incrementally. Conceptually, you can think of it as downloading an infinitely long file over HTTP.\u00a0 Once a connection has been established, the Twitter server will deliver Tweet events through the connection as long as the connection is open.  \n#### Consuming data in real time  \nNote that the individual fields of JSON objects are not ordered, and not all fields will be present in all circumstances. Similarly, separate activities are not delivered in sorted order, and duplicate messages may be encountered. Keep in mind that over time, new message types may be added and sent through the stream.  \nThus, your client must tolerate:  \n* Fields appearing in any order\n* Unexpected or missing fields\n* Non-sorted Tweets\n* Duplicate messages\n* New arbitrary message types coming down the stream at any time  \nIn addition to relevant Tweet data and requested field parameters, the following kinds of messages may be delivered on a stream connection. Note that this list may not be comprehensive\u2014additional objects may be introduced into streams. Ensure that your parser is tolerant of unexpected message formats.  \n#### Buffering  \nThe streaming endpoints will send data to you as quickly as it becomes available, which can result in high volumes in many cases. If the Twitter server cannot write new data to the stream right away (for example if your client is not reading fast enough, see [handling disconnections](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/handling-disconnections.html) for more), it will buffer the content on its end to allow your client to catch up. However, when this buffer is full, a forced disconnect will be initiated to drop the connection, and the buffered Tweets will be dropped and not resent. See below for more details.  \nOne way to identify times where your app is falling behind is to compare the timestamp of the Tweets being received with the current time, and track this over time.  \nAlthough stream backups cannot ever be completely eliminated due to potential latency and hiccups over the public internet, they can be largely eliminated through proper configuration of your app. To minimize the occurrence of backups:  \n* Ensure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.\n* Ensure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 5-10x normal volume). For filtered stream, the volume and corresponding bandwidth required on your end are wholly dependent on what Tweets your rules are matching.  \n#### Usage tracking and rule management  \nAs developers expectations around what \u201cnormal\u201d data volume should be for their streams, we do not have a general recommendation for a specific percentage decrease/increase or period of time.  \nConsider monitoring your stream data volumes for unexpected deviations. A data volume decrease may be symptomatic of a different issue than a stream disconnection. In such a situation, a stream would still be receiving the keep-alive signal and probably some new activity data. However, a significantly decreased number of Tweets should lead you to investigate whether there is anything causing the decrease in inbound data volume to your application or network, check the [status page](https://api.twitterstat.us/) for any related notices.  \nTo create such monitoring, you could track the number of new Tweets you expect to see in a set amount of time. If a stream\u2019s data volume falls far enough below the specified threshold, and does not recover within a set period of time, then alerts and notifications should be initiated. You may also want to monitor for a large increase in data volume, particularly if you are in the process of modifying rules in a filtered stream, or if an event occurs that produces a spike in Tweet activity.  \nIt's important to note that Tweets delivered through filtered stream do count towards the total monthly Tweet volume, and you should track and adjust consumption in order to optimize.\u00a0 If volume is high, consider adding a sample: operator to each of your rules to reduce from 100% matching to sample:50 or sample:25\u00a0when necessary.  \nAdditionally, we encourage you to implement measures within your app that will alert your team if the volume passes a pre-set threshold, and to possibly introduce other measures such as automated deletion of rules that are bringing in too much data, or disconnecting from the stream completely in extreme circumstances.  \n#### Responding to system messages  \nKeep-alive signals\nAt least every 20 seconds, the stream will send a keep-alive signal, or heartbeat in the form of an \\\\r\\\\n carriage return through the open connection to prevent your client from timing out. Your client application should be tolerant of the \\\\r\\\\n characters in the stream.  \nIf your client properly implements a read timeout on your HTTP library, your app will be able to rely on the HTTP protocol and your HTTP library to throw an event if no data is read within this period, and you will not need to explicitly monitor for the \\\\r\\\\n character.  \nThis event will typically be an exception being thrown or some other event depending on the HTTP library used. It is highly recommended to wrap your HTTP methods with error/event handlers to detect these timeouts. On timeout, your application should attempt to reconnect.  \nError messages\nThe v2 streaming endpoints may also deliver in stream error messages. Provided below is the basic format of these messages, along with some examples. Please note that the messages delivered could change, with new message being introduced. Client applications need to be tolerant of changing system message payloads.  \nNote that error messages will link to the documentation describing how to solve the problem.  \nMessage format:  \n`{ \t\"errors\": [{ \t\t\"title\": \"operational-disconnect\", \t\t\"disconnect_type\": \"UpstreamOperationalDisconnect\", \t\t\"detail\": \"This stream has been disconnected upstream for operational reasons.\", \t\t\"type\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/operational-disconnect\" \t}] }`  \nNote that error messages indicating a force disconnect for a full buffer may never get to your client, if the backup which caused the force disconnect prevents it from getting through. Accordingly, your app should not depend on these messages to initiate a reconnect.\n",

Before you start receiving Tweets in your stream, you\u2019ll need to create a rule which specifies what types of Tweets you\u2019re interested in.  \nWhen you specify your rules to match Tweets based on a wide variety of attributes, including user attributes, geo-location, language, and many others, you can attach a tag to distinguish this rule at a higher level. Tags are a good way to contextualize your rule, especially if you have many rules in place. The filtering rules determine which Tweet activities will be sent through the connection.  \nIf you need to add a new filtering rule to capture a different type of Tweet, or remove an existing rule, your app can send a request to the [POST tweets/search/stream/rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules.html) endpoint to make it happen. When that request is sent, the filtering rules are automatically modified and the changes simply take effect in the data stream with no need to reconnect. Most rule additions take effect\u00a0 about 20 seconds or less. It\u2019s unlikely, but depending on external factors (for example, network connectivity), it may take longer before you start receiving matching Tweets. If you can\u2019t find a rule in the list rule endpoint, make sure that the rule creation request succeeded; this can be done by checking your logs for any error messages.\n",

If multiple rules match a single Tweet, the activity is delivered a single time with each of the matching rules included in this metadata. The matching rules provide an easy way to associate a specific Tweet with specific rules, which is especially helpful if you have many distinct rules. Since the data is delivered through a single stream in this manner, ensuring you have unique\u00a0id and tag is essential for matching.  \n#### Here is an example of how the \u201dmatching\\_rules\u201d array appears in the Tweet payload:  \n`\"matching_rules\": [     {       \"id\": \"1166916266197536768\",       \"tag\": \"test-rule-tag-00000\"     },     {       \"id\": \"1166916266197536769\",       \"tag\": \"test-rule-tag-12345\"     }   ]`\n",

Rule tags have no special meaning as they are simply treated as opaque strings carried along with a rule. They will be included in the matching\\_rules metadata in activities returned, and are aimed at making distinguishing your rules easier at a higher level.  \nTags provide an easy way to create logical groupings of filtering rules. For example, you may generate a unique ID for a specific rule as its tag, and allow your app to reference that ID within activities it processes to associate a result with specific customers, campaigns, categories, or other related groups.  \nNote that tags cannot be updated on an existing rule and can only be included when a rule is created. In order to \u201cupdate\u201d or \u201crename\u201d a tag, you need to first delete the rule, then add it again with the desired tag. The best solution is to simply use a unique identifier as your tag, which your system can associate with various other data points within your own app, all without having to change anything in the rule set.\n",

This provides redundancy by allowing you to connect to the same stream with two separate consumers, receiving the same data through both connections. Thus, your app has a hot failover for various situations such as if one stream is disconnected or if your application's primary server fails.  \nFiltered stream currently only allows Projects with Enterprise access\u00a0to connect to up to two redundant connections. To use a redundant stream, simply connect to the same URL used for your primary connection. The data for your stream will be sent through both connections.\n",

If possible, your system should take note of how long the disconnection lasted so that you can use the proper recovery feature to backfill the data.  \nIf you are using a Project with Enterprise access and identified that the disconnection lasted five minutes or less, you can use the backfill parameter, backfill\\_minutes.\u00a0If you pass this parameter with your\u00a0[GET /tweets/search/stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-search-stream)\u00a0request, you will receive the Tweets that match your rules within the past one to five minutes. We generally deliver these older Tweets first before any newly matched Tweets, and also do not deduplicate Tweets. This means that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, but request two minutes worth of backfill data, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Tweets, which your system should be tolerant of. Here is an example of what a request might look like with the backfill parameter:  \n`curl 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?backfill_minutes=5' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\"`  \nIf you don't have Enterprise access, or identified that the disconnection time lasted for longer than five minutes, you can utilize the\u00a0[recent search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction)\u00a0or the recovery feature to request missed data. However, note that the search Tweets endpoints do not include the sample:, bio:, bio\\_name:, or bio\\_location: operators, and has certain differences in matching behavior when using accents and diacritics with the keyword and #hashtag operators. These differences could mean that you don't fully recover all Tweets that might have been received via the filtered stream endpoints.\n",

Recovery enables you to 'replay' the time period of missed data. A recovery stream is started when you make a connection request using 'start\\_time' and 'end\\_time' request parameters. Once connected, Recovery will re-stream the time period indicated, then disconnect.  \nYou will be able to make 2 concurrent requests to recovery at the same time, i.e. \u201ctwo recovery jobs\u201d. Recovery works technically in the same way as backfill, except a start and end time is defined. A recovery period is for a single time range.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| start\\_time | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339).<br><br>Date in UTC signifying the start time to recover from. |\n| end\\_time | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339).<br><br>Date in UTC signifying the end time to recover to. |  \nExample request URL:\u00a0[https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?start\\_time=2022-07-12T15:10:00Z&end\\_time=2022-07-12T15:20:00Z](https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?start_time=1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z&end_time=1985-04-13T00:20:50.52Z)\n",

With v2 filtered stream, you instead use a set of [operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule) that can be connected together using boolean logic to filter for desired Tweets. The available operators include some that are direct replacements for the existing standard v1.1 parameters.  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalent operators in Twitter API v2:  \n| **Standard** | **Twitter API v2** |\n| --- | --- |\n| follow - A comma-separated list of user IDs, indicating the users whose Tweets should be delivered on the stream. | Many operators that can help you find Tweets related to specific users:<br><br>* @<br>* from:<br>* to:<br>* etc. |\n| track - A comma-separated list of phrases which will be used to determine what Tweets will be delivered on the stream. | Many operators that can help you find Tweets related to specific keywords:<br><br>* keyword<br>* \"exact phrase match\"<br>* #<br>* etc. |  \n**Support for Tweet edit history and metadata**  \nBoth versions provide metadata that describes any edit history. Check out the [filtered stream API References](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference) and the [Tweet edits fundamentals page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-edits) for more details.\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Authentication method  \nThe standard endpoint supports [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), whereas the Twitter API v2 filtered stream endpoints supports [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) (also referred to as Application-only authentication). To make requests to the Twitter API v2 version you must use a App Access Token to authenticate your requests.  \nIf you no longer have the App Access Token that was presented to you when you created your Project and app in the developer portal, you can generate a new one by navigating to your app's \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d page on the developer portal. If you\u2019d like to generate an App Access Token programmatically, see this\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App-Only guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only).  \n#### Rule volume and persistent stream  \nThe standard v1.1 endpoint supports a single rule to filter the streaming connection. To change the rule, you have to disconnect the stream and submit a new request with the revised filtering rules submitted as parameters.  \nThe Twitter API v2 filtered stream endpoint allows you to apply multiple rules to a single stream and add and remove rules to your stream while maintaining the stream connection.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet id and text fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you wil need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThere are also a set of standard filtered stream request parameters **not**\u00a0supported in Twitter API v2:  \n| Standard v1.1 parameter | Details |\n| --- | --- |\n| locations - A comma-separated list of longitude,latitude pairs specifying a set of bounding boxes to filter Tweets by. | We have not released location-based operators for Twitter API v2 yet. |\n| Delimited | With the v1.1 endpoint, setting this to the string length indicates that statuses should be delimited in the stream, so that clients know how many bytes to read before the end of the status message.<br><br>This functionality is not available with Twitter API v2. |\n| Stall\\_warnings | With the v1.1 endpoint, setting this parameter to true will cause periodic messages to be delivered if the client is in danger of being disconnected.\u00a0<br><br>With Twitter API v2, stall warnings are sent by default with the new line sent every so often. |  \n####\nAvailability of recovery and redundancy features  \nThe Twitter API v2 version of filtered stream introduces recovery and redundancy features that can help you maximize streaming up-time as well as recover any Tweets that might have been missed due to a disconnection that lasted five minutes or less.  \nRedundant connections allows you to connect to a given stream up to two times, which can help ensure that you maintain a connection to the stream at all times, even if one of your connections fails.  \nThe\u00a0backfill\\_minutes\u00a0parameter can be used to recover up to five minutes of missed data.  \nBoth of these features are only available via [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level). You can learn more about this functionality via our\u00a0[recovery and redundancy features](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/recovery-and-redundancy-features)\u00a0integration guide.  \n#### New query operators  \nTwitter API v2 introduces new operators in support of two new features:  \n* **[Conversation IDs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id)** - As conversations unfold on Twitter, a conservation ID will be available to mark Tweets that are part of the conversation. All Tweets in the conversation will have their conversation\\_id set to the Tweet ID that started it.\n* conversation\\_id:\n* **[Twitter Annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)** provide contextual information about Tweets, and include entity and context annotations. Entities are comprised of people, places, products and organizations. Contexts are domains, or topics, that surfaced entities are a part of. For example, people mentioned in a Tweet may have a context that indicates whether they are an athlete, actor, or politician.\n* context: - matches on Tweets that have been annotated with a context of interest.\n* entity: - matches on Tweets that have been annotated with an entity of interest.\n",

Both PowerTrack and Twitter API v2 filtered stream endpoint connections deliver data in real time and should be read by the connecting client quickly.  \n#### Integration process  \nIntegrating with filtered stream is similar to integrating with PowerTrack, using the general process below:  \n1. Establish a streaming connection.\n2. Asynchronously send separate requests to add and delete rules from the stream.\n3. Reconnect to the stream automatically when connection is disconnected.  \n#### Persistent stream connection with separate rules management endpoints  \nSimilar to the PowerTrack API and Rules API, the new Twitter API v2 filtered stream endpoints allows you to apply multiple rules to a single stream and add and remove rules to your stream while maintaining the stream connection.  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Feature** | **PowerTrack API** | **Twitter API v2 filtered stream** |\n| **Connection endpoint** | [GET /stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference/powertrack-stream.html) | [GET /2/tweets/search/stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-search-stream.html) |\n| **Add rules** | [POST /rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference/powertrack-rules.html#AddRules) | [POST /2/tweets/search/stream/rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules.html) |\n| **Get rules** | [GET /rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference/powertrack-rules.html#ListRules) | [GET /2/tweets/search/stream/rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-search-stream-rules.html) |\n| **Delete rules** | [POST /rules\\_method=delete](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference/powertrack-rules.html#DeleteRules) | [POST /2/tweets/search/stream/rules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/post-tweets-search-stream-rules.html) |  \n#### Rule syntax, operators, and matching rules logic  \nThe Twitter API v2 filtered stream uses a subset of the same rule operators currently used for PowerTrack rules.\u00a0These operators are used to create boolean based rule syntax used for filtering desired matching Tweets from the live stream.\u00a0 Both PowerTrack and filtered stream use the same rule syntax for building rules and matching logic is the same. While the majority of the operators are available for both PowerTrack and filter stream, there are a few notable differences and net new operators listed below.\u00a0 For more details and example uses for each operator see current [PowerTrack operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/operators.html) and current Twitter API v2 [filtered stream operators](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule.html).  \nPlease note that many operators (noted as 'advanced operators') are reserved for those users who have been approved for [Academic Research access or Enterprise access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level).  \nOperators available with both PowerTrack and Twitter API v2 Filter stream:  \n| **Standalone operators** | **Conjunction required operators (must be used with at least one standalone operator within a rule)** |\n| --- | --- |\n| keyword (example: coffee )<br><br>emoji (example: \ud83d\udc36 or\u00a0\\\\uD83D\\\\uDC36 )<br><br>\"exact phrase match\" (example: \"happy birthday\" )<br><br>from:<br><br>to:<br><br>@<br><br>retweets\\_of:<br><br>#<br><br>url: | has:links<br><br>lang:<br><br>has:mentions<br><br>has:media<br><br>has:images<br><br>has:videos<br><br>is:retweet<br><br>is:quote<br><br>is:verified<br><br>has:hashtags<br><br>has:geo<br><br>sample:<br><br>\\-is:nullcast |  \n|     |\n| --- |\n| **Net new operators available with Twitter API v2 filtered stream** |\n| conversation\\_id:\u00a0- matches on Tweets that exist in any reply threads from the specified Tweet conversation root.Net new operators available with Twitter API v2 filtered stream:<br><br>context:\u00a0- matches on Tweets that have been annotated with a context of interest.\u00a0<br><br>entity:\u00a0- matches on Tweets that have been annotated with an entity of interest. |  \n|     |\n| --- |\n| **Operators currently only available on PowerTrack API** |\n| url\\_title:<br><br>url\\_description:<br><br>followers\\_count:<br><br>statuses\\_count:<br><br>friends\\_count:<br><br>listed\\_count:<br><br>\"proximity match\"~3<br><br>contains:<br><br>has:symbols<br><br>url\\_contains:<br><br>in\\_reply\\_to\\_status\\_id:<br><br>retweets\\_of\\_status\\_id:<br><br>source:<br><br>bio:<br><br>bio\\_name:<br><br>bio\\_location:<br><br>place:<br><br>place\\_country:<br><br>point\\_radius:<br><br>bounding\\_box:<br><br>is:reply<br><br>(Available without conjunction)<br><br>has:links<br><br>lang:<br><br>has:mentions<br><br>has:media<br><br>has:images<br><br>has:videos<br><br>is:retweet<br><br>is:quote<br><br>is:verified<br><br>is:reply<br><br>has:hashtags<br><br>has:geo<br><br>sample: |  \n**Support for Tweet edit history and metadata**  \nBoth versions provide metadata that describes any edit history.

The developer App and Project setup for Twitter API v2 access is all done through the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).  \n#### Authentication method  \nThe PowerTrack API endpoints use Basic Authentication set up in console.gnip.com. The Twitter API v2 filtered stream endpoints require a Twitter developer App and an [OAuth 2.0 App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) (also referred to as Application-only or Bearer Authentication). To make requests to the Twitter API v2 version you must use your specific developer App's Access Token to authenticate your requests.  \nIn the process of setting up your developer account, developer App and Project, an App Access Token is created and shared within the dev portal user interface, however, you can generate a new one by navigating to your app's \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d page on the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps). If you\u2019d like to generate/destroy the App Access Tokens programmatically, see this [OAuth 2.0 App-Only guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only.html).  \n#### Usage tracking  \nPowerTrack usage can be retrieved programatically using the Usage API, or can be seen in console.gnip.com on the [usage tab](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/console/usage.html).\u00a0 Tweet consumption across all PowerTrack streams is deduplicated each day and volume consumption is defined within the enterprise contract.  \nTwitter API v2 filtered stream usage can be tracked within the developer portal at the Project level.\u00a0 Tweet consumption is [set at the Project level](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview.html) and is shared across several different Twitter API v2 endpoints, including filtered stream, recent search, user Tweet timeline and user mention timeline.\u00a0 Currently with Basic Access, the monthly Tweet consumption limit is 500,000 Tweets per month total, and Tweets are not deduplicated across products or time.  \n#### Multiple streams, redundant conections, backfill and Replay API for recovery  \nThere are several recovery and redunancy features available via PowerTrack, some of which are not yet available for Twitter API v2 filtered stream.\u00a0 For PowerTrack, all\u00a0[recovery and redundancy features](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/powertrack_recovery_and_redundancy_features.html) are configured within the enterprise contract. PowerTrack API currently has the flexibility to offer multiple PowerTrack streams (commonly \"dev\" and \"production\") with unique rulesets.\u00a0 Currently, the Twitter API v2 filtered stream is only available with a single stream.  \nPowerTrack allows you to connect to have multiple connections to a single stream, generally used for redundant connections to different data centers or clients. If you have [Academic Research access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level), you will have access redundant connections, enabling you to make up to two connections to a single stream.  \nIf a PowerTrack stream is disconnected breifly, a reconnection can be made using the backfillMinutes parameter to reduce the chance of data loss within five minutes of the disconection. While we have added this functionality to the Twitter API v2 version, it is currently only available with Academic Research access, and has been renamed to backfill\\_minutes.  \nIf a PowerTrack stream is disconnected for longer than a 5 minute period, the separate [Replay API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference/replay-stream.html) can be used to recover data for up to a 2 hour period in the recent 5 day past.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, the Twitter API v2 filtered stream does not have a replay feature.  \n#### Request parameters and response format  \nOne of the biggest differences between PowerTrack API and Twitter API v2 filtered stream is the parameter functionality.  \nUsing the Twitter API v2 filtered stream, there are several parameters used on the connection request to identify which fields or expanded objects to return in the Tweet payload.\u00a0 This is common for all v2 endpoints. By default, only the Tweet\u00a0id\u00a0and\u00a0text\u00a0are returned for matching Tweets but additional parameters, fields and expansions described below, can be added in order to recieve more detailed data per matching Tweet.  \nfields: Twitter API v2 endpoints enable you to select which fields are provided in your payload. For example, Tweet, User, Media, Place, and Poll objects all have a list of fields that can be returned (or not).  \nexpansions: Used to expand the complementary objects referenced in Tweet JSON payloads. For example, all Retweets and Replies reference other Tweets. By setting expansions=referenced\\_tweets.id, these other Tweet objects are expanded according to the \\`tweet.fields\\` setting.\u00a0 Other objects such as users, polls, and media can be expanded.  \nhttps://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?tweet.fields=created\\_at,public\\_metrics,author\\_id,entities&expansions=attachments.poll\\_ids  \nYou can learn more about how to use fields and expansions by visiting our\u00a0[guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions), and by reading through our broader\u00a0[data dictionary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Connection to PowerTrack** | **Example request to Twitter API v2 filtered stream** |\n| curl --compressed -v -uexample@customer.com \"https://gnip-stream.twitter.com/stream/powertrack/accounts/:account\\_name/publishers/twitter/:stream\\_label.json\" | curl \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream?tweet.fields=attachments,author\\_id,context\\_annotations,conversation\\_id,created\\_at,entities,geo,id,in\\_reply\\_to\\_user\\_id,lang,possibly\\_sensitive,public\\_metrics,referenced\\_tweets,reply\\_settings,source,text,withheld&user.fields=created\\_at,description,entities,id,location,name,pinned\\_tweet\\_id,profile\\_image\\_url,protected,public\\_metrics,url,username,verified,withheld&expansions=author\\_id,referenced\\_tweets.id,referenced\\_tweets.id.author\\_id,entities.mentions.username,attachments.poll\\_ids,attachments.media\\_keys,in\\_reply\\_to\\_user\\_id,geo.place\\_id&place.fields=contained\\_within,country,country\\_code,full\\_name,geo,id,name,place\\_type&poll.fields=duration\\_minutes,end\\_datetime,id,options,voting\\_status\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS\\_TOKEN\" |  \nThe PowerTrack API data format is set within console.gnip.com at the stream settings level, which can be set to either the Twitter\u00a0[native enriched format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/native-enriched-objects/tweet.html)\u00a0or\u00a0[Activity streams format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/activity.html).  \nPowerTrack API only uses one optional parameter on connection, to reconnect using backfill (backfillMinutes=5). This optional parameter is also available to filtered stream, but is called backfill\\_minutes, and is only available via Academic Research access.  \nhttps://gnip-stream.twitter.com/stream/powertrack/accounts/{account\\_name}/publishers/twitter/{stream\\_label}.json?backfillMinutes=5  \n#### Response structure and data format  \nAs described above, the request parameters set at the connection request for Twitter API v2 filtered stream determine the response data returned.\u00a0 There are several different response possibilites using different fields and expansions which can range from the most simple default response with only the Tweet id and text, to an extremely detailed and expanded data payload.  \nThe data format for PowerTrack is set within console.gnip.com at the stream settings level, which can be set to either the Twitter Native Enriched format or Activity Streams format.  \nThe following table references Tweet response examples in each different format:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Native enriched format** | **Activity streams format** | **Twitter API v2 filtered stream format** |\n| [Payload examples](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/native-enriched-objects/enriched-native-example-payloads) | [Payload examples](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/example-payloads.html) | [Payload examples](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/example-payloads.html) |  \nIf you would like to know more about how the enterprise data formats map to the Twitter API v2 format, please visit our following guides:  \n* [Native Enriched to Twitter API v2 format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/native-enriched-to-v2)\n* [Activity Streams to Twitter API v2 format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/activity-streams-to-v2)\n",

The sampled stream endpoint is a very simple one. All you will have to do is replace or add a couple of elements of the below request and submit it to your command line tool.  \n`curl -X GET \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample/stream\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $APP_ACCESS_TOKEN\"`  \n#### Step two: Authenticate your request  \nSince sampled stream requires [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only)\u00a0authentication, you will need to replace $APP\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN with the App Access Token that you generated in the prerequisites.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you connect to the stream after step two, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet) fields in your response: id\u00a0,\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond these default fields,\u00a0you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request a three different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary Tweet objects.\n2. The associated authors\u2019 user object\u2019s default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, username\n3. The additional\u00a0 user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nTo request these fields, you will need to pass the following in your request:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |\n| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |  \nOnce you've added these, the URL in your cURL request should look like the following:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample/stream?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at`  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, you can submit your request to Twitter using a command line tool. If done successfully, you will receive a live stream of Tweets with payloads similar to the following:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2020-02-14T19:00:55.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1228393702244134912\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1228393702244134912\"],       \"text\": \"What did the developer write in their Valentine\u2019s card?\\n  \\nwhile(true) {\\n    I = Love(You);  \\n}\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2020-02-12T17:09:56.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1227640996038684673\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1227640996038684673\"],       \"text\": \"Doctors: Googling stuff online does not make you a doctor\\n\\nDevelopers: https://t.co/mrju5ypPkb\"     },     {       \"author_id\": \"2244994945\",       \"created_at\": \"2019-11-27T20:26:41.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1199786642791452673\",       \"edit_history_tweet_ids\": [\"1199786642791452673\"],       \"text\": \"C#\"     }   ],   \"includes\": {     \"users\": [       {         \"created_at\": \"2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z\",         \"id\": \"2244994945\",         \"name\": \"Twitter Dev\",         \"username\": \"TwitterDev\"       }     ]   } }`  \nIf you would like to close your connection, you can press Control-C in your command line tool on either Mac or Windows systems to break the connection, or you can also close the window.  \n#### Using the 10% sampled stream  \nIf you have Enterprise access and are working with the 10% sampled stream, note the following differences:  \n* The request URL changes from api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample/stream\u00a0to api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample10/stream.  \n* The 10% sample stream is split into 2 partitions, each requiring a connection request. Use the partition request parameter to indicate which partition you are connecting to:  \n* /2/tweets/sample10/stream&partition=1  \n* /2/tweets/sample10/stream&partition=2\n",

When disconnects occur, it is important for your client to automatically detect the disconnection,\u00a0[handle the disconnection](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/sampled-stream/integrate/handling-disconnections)\u00a0and reconnect quickly.\n",

When connecting to the sampled stream endpoint, you should form a HTTPS request and consume the resulting stream for as long as is practical. Our servers will hold the connection open indefinitely, barring server-side error, excessive client-side lag, network issues, routine server maintenance, or duplicate logins. With connections to streaming endpoints, it is likely, and should be expected, that disconnections will take place and reconnection logic built.\n",

Inspect the error message returned by the stream to understand the reason for the failure. Possible reasons for disconnections are as follows:  \n* An authentication error (such as a wrong token or a wrong authentication method being used).\n* A streaming server is restarted on the Twitter side. This is usually related to a code deploy and should be generally expected and designed around.\n* Your client is not keeping up with the volume of Tweets the stream is delivering or is reading data too slowly. Every streaming connection is backed by a queue of messages to be sent to the client. If this queue grows too large over time, the connection will be closed.\n* Your account exceeded your daily/monthly quota of Tweets.\n* You have too many active redundant connections.\n* A client stops reading data suddenly. If the rate of Tweets being read off of the stream drops suddenly, the connection will be closed.\n* Possible networking issues between server and client\n* A temporary server side issue, scheduled maintenance and updates. (Check the\u00a0[status page](https://api.twitterstat.us/))  \n#### Common disconnection errors include:  \n`{ \t\"errors\": [{ \t\t\"title\": \"operational-disconnect\", \t\t\"disconnect_type\": \"UpstreamOperationalDisconnect\", \t\t\"detail\": \"This stream has been disconnected upstream for operational reasons.\", \t\t\"type\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/operational-disconnect\" \t}] }`  \n` { \t\"title\": \"ConnectionException\", \t\"detail\": \"This stream is currently at the maximum allowed connection limit.\", \t\"connection_issue\": \"TooManyConnections\", \t\"type\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/streaming-connection\" }`\n",

The endpoint provides a 20-second keep alive heartbeat (it will look like a new line character). Use this signal to detect if you\u2019re being disconnected.  \n1. Your code should detect when fresh content and the heartbeat stop arriving.\n2. If that happens, your code should trigger a reconnection logic. Some clients and languages allow you to specify a read timeout, which you can set to 20 seconds.\n3. Your service should detect these disconnections and reconnect as soon as possible.  \nThe code samples on the API reference page\u00a0provide an example of this reconnect logic.  \nOnce an established connection drops, attempt to reconnect immediately. If the reconnect fails, slow down your reconnect attempts according to the type of error experienced:  \n* Back off linearly for TCP/IP level network errors. These problems are generally temporary and tend to clear quickly. Increase the delay in reconnects by 250ms each attempt, up to 16 seconds.\n* Back off exponentially for HTTP errors for which reconnecting would be appropriate. Start with a 5 second wait, doubling each attempt, up to 320 seconds.\n* Back off exponentially for HTTP 429 errors Rate limit exceeded. Start with a 1 minute wait and double each attempt. Note that every HTTP 429 received increases the time you must wait until rate limiting will no longer be in effect for your account.\n",

This is useful to understand how many reconnections attempts are allowed for the streaming endpoint.  \n* x-rate-limit-limit indicates the number of allotted requests your client is allowed to make during the 15-minute window.  \n* x-rate-limit-remaining indicates the number of requests made so far in the 15-minute window.  \n* x-rate-limit-reset is a UNIX timestamp indicating when the 15-minute window will restart, resetting x-rate-limit-remaining to 0.  \nThe sampled stream endpoint does not currently report usage data. To check how many Tweets have been delivered, your code can implement a metering logic, so that consumption can be measured and paused if needed.  \nYour code that hosts the client side of the stream simply inserts incoming Tweets into a first in, first out (FIFO) queue, or a similar memory structure; a separate process/thread should consume Tweets from that queue to parse and prepare content for storage. With this design, you can implement a service that can scale efficiently in case incoming Tweet volumes changes dramatically. Conceptually, you can think of it as downloading an infinitely long file over HTTP.\n",

A good implementation will not get any 429 responses.  \n#### Issue alerts for multiple reconnects  \nIf a client reaches its upper threshold of its time between reconnects, it should send you notifications so you can triage the issues affecting your connection.  \n#### Handle DNS changes  \nTest that your client process honors the DNS Time To live (TTL). Some stacks will cache a resolved address for the duration of the process and will not pick up DNS changes within the prescribed TTL. Such aggressive caching will lead to service disruptions on your client as Twitter shifts load between IP addresses.  \n#### User Agent  \nEnsure your user-agent HTTP header includes the client\u2019s version. This will be critical in diagnosing issues on Twitter\u2019s end. If your environment precludes setting the user-agent field, then set an x-user-agent header.\n",

Thus, your app has a hot failover for various situations such as if one stream is disconnected or if your application's primary server fails.  \nSampled stream currently only allows those with [Enterprise Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise)\u00a0to connect to up to two redundant connections. To use a redundant stream, simply connect to the same URL used for your primary connection. The data for your stream will be sent through both connections.\n",

If possible, your system should take note of how long the disconnection lasted so that you can use the proper recovery feature to backfill the data.  \nIf you are using a Project with Academic Research access and identified that the disconnection lasted five minutes or less, you can use the backfill parameter, backfill\\_minutes.\u00a0If you pass this parameter with your\u00a0[GET /tweets/sample/stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/sampled-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-sample-stream)\u00a0request, you will receive the Tweets that match your rules within the past one to five minutes. We generally deliver these older Tweets first before any newer sampled Tweets, and also do not deduplicate Tweets. This means that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, but request two minutes worth of backfill data, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Tweets, which your system should be tolerant of. Here is an example of what a request might look like with the backfill parameter:  \n`curl 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample/stream?backfill_minutes=5' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN\"`  \nIf you don't have access to the Enterprise access, or identified that the disconnection time lasted for longer than five minutes, you can try to utilize the\u00a0[recent search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction)\u00a0to request missed data.

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.  \n#### Authentication method  \nThe standard endpoint supports [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), whereas the new Twitter API v2 sample stream endpoint supports [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) (also referred to as Application-only authentication). To make requests to the Twitter API v2 version you must use a Bearer Token to authenticate your requests.  \nYou can easily obtain a Bearer Token on navigating to your app's \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d page on the developer portal. If you\u2019d like to generate a Bearer Token, see this [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only).  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet id and text fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you wil need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThere is also a set of standard v1.1 request parameters not supported in Twitter API v2:  \n| **Standard v1.1 parameter** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Delimited | With the v1.1 endpoint, setting this to the string length indicates that statuses should be delimited in the stream, so that clients know how many bytes to read before the end of the status message.<br><br>This functionality is not available with Twitter API v2 |\n| Stall\\_warnings | With the v1.1 endpoint, setting this parameter to the string true will cause periodic messages to be delivered if the client is in danger of being disconnected.\u00a0<br><br>With Twitter API v2, stall warnings are sent by default with the new line sent every so often. |  \n####\nAvailability of recovery and redundancy features  \nThe Twitter API v2 version of sampled stream introduces recovery and redundancy features that can help you maximize streaming up-time as well as recover any Tweets that might have been missed due to a disconnection that lasted five minutes or less.  \nRedundant connections allows you to connect to a given stream up to two times, which can help ensure that you maintain a connection to the stream at all times, even if one of your connections fails.  \nThe\u00a0backfill\\_minutes\u00a0parameter can be used to recover up to five minutes of missed data.  \nBoth of these features are only available to those that have been approved for Academic Research access.

You must include a whole number between 1 and 5 as the value to this parameter.  <br>  <br>This feature will deliver duplicate Tweets, meaning that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, and you requested two minutes of backfill, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Tweets. Due to this, you should make sure your system is tolerant of duplicate data.  <br>  <br>This feature is currently only available to those that have been approved for Academic Research access. To learn more about this access level, please visit our section on [Academic Research](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research). |\n| `end_time`  <br>\u00a0Optional | date (ISO 8601) | Used to initiate a stream for recovering missing data from the previous 24 hours. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Requires Enterprise access. Used with `start_time` to indicate period of missing data. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which the Tweets will be provided.

Submit a list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the Tweet data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the `includes` response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object.  <br>  <br>The following data objects can be expanded using this parameter:  <br><br>* The Tweet author's user object<br>* The user object of the Tweet\u2019s author that the original Tweet is responding to<br>* Any mentioned users\u2019 object<br>* Any referenced Tweets\u2019 author\u2019s user object<br>* Attached media\u2019s object<br>* Attached poll\u2019s object<br>* Attached place\u2019s object<br>* Any referenced Tweets\u2019 object (this includes Tweet objects for previous versions of an edited Tweet) |\n| `media.fields`  <br>\u00a0Optional | enum (`duration_ms`, `height`, `media_key`, `preview_image_url`, `type`, `url`, `width`, `public_metrics`, `alt_text`, `variants`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [media fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/media) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media and if you've also included the `expansions=attachments.media_keys` query parameter in your request. While the media ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional media fields in the `includes` data object. |\n| `place.fields`  <br>\u00a0Optional | enum (`contained_within`, `country`, `country_code`, `full_name`, `geo`, `id`, `name`, `place_type`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [place fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/place) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields.

The 10% sampled stream is split into 2 partitions, each requiring their own connection request. Use this parameter to specify which partition you are connecting to. |\n| `backfill_minutes`  <br>\u00a0Optional | integer | By passing this parameter, you can request up to five (5) minutes worth of streaming data that you might have missed during a disconnection to be delivered to you upon reconnection. The backfilled Tweets will automatically flow through the reconnected stream, with older Tweets generally being delivered before any newly matching Tweets. You must include a whole number between 1 and 5 as the value to this parameter.  <br>  <br>This feature will deliver duplicate Tweets, meaning that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, and you requested two minutes of backfill, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Tweets. Due to this, you should make sure your system is tolerant of duplicate data.  <br>  <br>This feature is currently only available to those that have been approved for Academic Research access.

For this endpoint group, there are two methods available POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to Retweet a Tweet, and the DELETE method will enable you to undo a Retweet of a given Tweet.  \nSince you are making requests on behalf of a user, you must authenticate these endpoints with either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), and utilize the user Access Tokens associated with the user you are making the request on behalf of. You can generate this user Access Token using the\u00a0[3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens)\u00a0(OAuth 1.0a) or using the\u00a0[Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token)\u00a0(OAuth 2.0). You can Retweet a Tweet from your account or an account of an authenticated user. With both endpoints, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes per endpoint.  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/retweets/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=%2F2%2Fusers%2F%7Bid%7D%2Fretweets&method=post)\n",

To do so, this endpoint requires you to authenticate your request with either\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only),\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0authentication methods.  \nFor simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0or Retweets.  \nTo utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens, specifically the\u00a0[App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)\u00a0(also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify a Tweet  \nWith this endpoint, you must specify the Tweet ID that you want to get Retweeting users of.\u00a0\u00a0You can find the ID of a Tweet by navigating to that Tweet on Twitter and pulling the numerical code at the end of the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is\u00a01354143047324299264.  \nhttps://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1354143047324299264  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this username into the \"Value\" column of the id path variable (at the bottom of the section), making sure to not include any spaces before or after usernames.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | The Tweet ID you want to get the Reweeting users of |  \n####\nStep four:\u00a0Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [user object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) fields in your response: id, name, and username.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond id, name, and username, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/fields)\u00a0and/or [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/expansions)\u00a0parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request three additional sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional user.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.\n2. The associated pinned Tweets\u2019 object\u2019s default fields for the returned users: id and text.\n3. The additional\u00a0 tweet.created\\_at field in the associated Tweet objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| user.fields | created\\_at | user.created\\_at |\n| expansions | pinned\\_tweet\\_id | tweet.id, tweet.text |\n| tweet.fields | created\\_at | tweet.created\\_at |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/1354143047324299264/retweeted_by?user.fields=created_at&expansions=pinned_tweet_id&tweet.fields=created_at`  \n#### Step five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"created_at\": \"2008-12-04T18:51:57.000Z\",       \"id\": \"17874544\",       \"username\": \"TwitterSupport\",       \"name\": \"Twitter Support\"     },     {       \"created_at\": \"2007-02-20T14:35:54.000Z\",       \"id\": \"783214\",       \"username\": \"Twitter\",       \"name\": \"Twitter\"     },     {       \"pinned_tweet_id\": \"1389270063807598594\",       \"created_at\": \"2018-11-21T14:24:58.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1065249714214457345\",       \"username\": \"TwitterSpaces\",       \"name\": \"Spaces\"     },     {       \"pinned_tweet_id\": \"1293595870563381249\",       \"created_at\": \"2007-05-23T06:01:13.000Z\",       \"id\": \"6253282\",       \"username\": \"TwitterAPI\",       \"name\": \"Twitter API\"     }   ],   \"includes\": {     \"tweets\": [       {         \"created_at\": \"2021-05-03T17:26:09.000Z\",         \"id\": \"1389270063807598594\",         \"text\": \"now, everyone with 600 or more followers can host a Space.\\n\\nbased on what we've learned, these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting because of their existing audience. before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we\u2019re focused on a few things. \ud83e\uddf5\"       },       {         \"created_at\": \"2020-08-12T17:11:04.000Z\",         \"id\": \"1293595870563381249\",         \"text\": \"Twitter API v2: Early Access released\\n\\nToday we announced Early Access to the first endpoints of the new Twitter API!\\n\\n#TwitterAPI #EarlyAccess #VersionBump https://t.co/g7v3aeIbtQ\"       }     ]   } }`\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request using either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code).  \nIn this example, we are going to use OAuth 1.0a User Context.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens \u2013 specifically your API Key, API Secret Key, OAuth 1.0a user Access Token, and OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret \u2013 to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify which Tweet you are going to Retweet  \nManage Retweets endpoints require two IDs: one for the user who wishes to Retweet or undo a Retweet and the id of the Tweet.  \nThe user\u2019s ID must correspond to the authenticating user\u2019s ID, meaning that you must pass the [Access Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) associated with the user ID when authenticating your request.\u00a0 In this case, you can specify the ID belonging to your own user. You can find your ID in two ways:  \n1. Using the [user lookup by username](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference) endpoint, you can pass a username and receive the id field.\n2. Looking at your Access Token, you will find that the numeric part is your user ID.  \nYou also must specify a Tweet that you want to Retweet. You can find the Tweet ID by navigating to twitter.com and clicking on a Tweet and then looking in the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is\u00a01228393702244134912.  \nhttps://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1228393702244134912  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab, and enter your ID into the \"Value\" column of the id path variable. and enter the ID of the Tweet you wish to Retweet as the value for thetweet\\_id parameter. Be sure not to include any spaces before or after any ID.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | (your user ID) |\n| tweet\\_id | (the ID of the Tweet you want to Retweet) |  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button, you will receive a response object containing the status of the relationship:  \n* If you receive a \"retweeted\": true, then the id is successfully Retweeting the tweet\\_id.  \n#### Step four: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{     \"data\": {         \"retweeted\": true     } }`  \nIf you receive a `\"retweeted\": true`\u00a0has successfully Retweeted the\u00a0`tweet_id`  \nIf you wish to undo a Retweet by the same user you can use the request entitled \u201cUndo a Retweet\u201d, which is also found in the \u201cRetweets\u201d folder of the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman. The `id` should be your user ID and `source_tweet_id` should be the Tweet ID to undo the Retweet of. You will not have to add this as a JSON body so you will want to make sure that you add in the requisite query params for id and `source_tweet_id`.  \nOn a successful undoing of a Retweet, you will receive a similar response to the following example:  \n`{   \"data\": {     \"retweeted\": false    } }`\n",

Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our [\"Using Postman\"](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman) page.  \n#### Code samples  \nInterested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We\u2019ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).  \n#### Third-party libraries  \nTake advantage of one of our communities\u2019 [third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.\n",

        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/X_Twitter-API-V2/Tweets.md\nParagraph location: \n\tResource URL: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/retweets/integrate\n\tIntegration guide\n\tKey concepts\n\nContent: \n### Key concepts  \n#### Authentication  \nAll Twitter API v2 endpoints require for you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens.  \nYou can use either OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token to authenticate your requests to the Retweets lookup endpoint.  \nThe manage Retweets endpoints require the use of OAuth 1.0a User Context, which means that you must use a set of API keys and user access tokens to make a successful request. The access tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of access tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the 3-legged OAuth flow.  \nPlease note that OAuth 1.0a can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a [library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) to properly authenticate your requests.  \n**Please note**  \nIf you are requesting the following fields, OAuth 1.0a User Context is required:  \n* tweet.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* tweet.fields.organic\\_metrics\n* media.fields.non\\_public\\_metrics\n* media.fields.promoted\\_metrics\n* media.fields.organic\\_metrics  \n#### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must [sign up for a\u00a0developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](https://developer-staging.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThe manage Retweets endpoints are limited to 50 requests per 15 min (per user). Additionally, for the POST endpoint, you are limited to 300 requests per 3-hour window (per user, per app).  \nWith the Retweets lookup endpoint, you are limited to 75 requests per 15-min window.  \n#### Fields and expansions  \nThe Twitter API v2 allows users to select exactly which data they want to return from the API using a set of tools called fields and expansions. The expansion parameter allows you to expand objects referenced in the payload. For example, this endpoint allows you to pull the following [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions):  \n* attachments.poll\\_ids\n* attachments.media\\_keys\n* author\\_id,\u00a0entities.mentions.username\n* geo.place\\_id\n* in\\_reply\\_to\\_user\\_id,\n* referenced\\_tweets.id,\n* referenced\\_tweets.id.author\\_id  \nThe fields parameter allows you to select exactly which [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) within the different data objects you would like to receive. These endpoints delivers Tweet objects primarily. By default, the Tweet object returns the\u00a0id and text\u00a0fields. To receive additional fields such as tweet.created\\_at or tweet.entities, you will have to specifically request those using a fields parameter. Some important fields that you may want to consider using in your integration are our poll data, metrics, Tweet annotations, and conversation ID fields.  \nWe\u2019ve added a guide on how to [use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions) together to our [Twitter API v2 data dictionary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \n#### Pagination  \nThis endpoint utilizes pagination so that responses are returned quickly. In cases where there are more results than what can be sent in a single response (up to 100 users) you will need to paginate. Use the\u00a0`max_results`\u00a0parameter to identify how many results will return per page, and the\u00a0`pagination_token`\u00a0parameter to return the next page of results. You can learn more by reviewing our\u00a0[pagination guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination).\n",

All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the user\u00a0id\u00a0, name, and username\u00a0fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you wil need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any user fields that you request from this endpoint will return in the primary user object. Any expanded Tweet object and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the user object by matching the IDs located in both the user and the expanded Tweet object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters accepted two request query parameters (user\\_id or screen\\_name). The Twitter API v2 only accepts the numerical user ID, and it must be passed as part of the endpoint path.\n",

It also makes it easy for researchers to study the full conversation around a Tweet including all its Quote Tweets.  \nHere is a Quote Tweet for a Tweet from @TwitterAPI:  \n> Today, OAuth 2.0 and new fine-grained permission scopes are available to all developers for Twitter API v2 endpoints. [https://t.co/rNxC0GQDoP](https://t.co/rNxC0GQDoP)\n>\n> \u2014 Twitter API (@TwitterAPI) [December 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/TwitterAPI/status/1470836235413295107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \nThe Quote Tweets lookup endpoint is a REST endpoint that takes a single path parameter to indicate the desired Tweet (by Tweet ID).  \nTweets are delivered in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent. Results are [paginated](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination.html) up to 100 Tweets per page (10 Tweets by default). Pagination tokens are provided for paging through large sets of Tweets.  \nThe Quote Tweets endpoint supports [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters, and returns the [new JSON data format](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction).  \nThis endpoint will always return the most recent edit, along with the edit history. Any Tweet collected after its 30-minute edit window will represent its final version and will include an array of IDs for all Tweets in its edit history. For Tweets with no edit history, this array will hold a single ID.  \nTo successfully make a request to this endpoint, you will need to authorize your request with the [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) authentication methods. You must use OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE when requesting non public metrics, promoted metrics or a protected user's timeline.  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/quote-tweets/quick-start.html)  \n[Jump to example requests](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=%2F2%2Ftweets%2F%7Bid%7D%2Fquote_tweets&method=get)\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication methods.  \nFor simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private [metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics) or Tweets.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThis variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Identify and specify the Tweet you would like to retrieve the Quote Tweets for  \nYou must specify a Tweet you would like to retrieve Quote Tweets for within the request by passing the\u00a0 Tweet ID.  \nIn this example, the Tweet ID that we will use is 1409931481552543749.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this Tweet ID into the \"Value\" column of the id\u00a0parameter.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | 1409931481552543749 |  \n#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet) fields in your response: id,\u00a0\u00a0text, and edit\\_history\\_tweet\\_ids.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request three additional different sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional tweet.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.  \n2. The associated authors\u2019 user object\u2019s default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username\n3. The additional\u00a0user.created\\_at field in the associated user objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |\n| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |\n| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |     |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/:id/quote_tweets?expansions=author_id&tweet.fields=created_at&user.fields=created_at`  \n**Please note:**  \nIn Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id`\u00a0params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 1409931481552543749.  \n####\nStep five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{  \"data\": [    {      \"created_at\":

For this endpoint group, there are two methods available POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to like a Tweet, and the DELETE method will enable you to unlike a Tweet.  \nSince you are making requests on behalf of a user, you must authenticate these endpoints with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) and use the Access Tokens associated with the user, which can be generated using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens). You can like a Tweet from your account or an account of an authenticated user. With both endpoints, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes per endpoint.  \nTo access these endpoint, you must have an approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview). When authenticating, you must use keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started)\u00a0page.  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/likes/quick-start)  \n[Sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)\n",

To do so, this endpoint requires you to authenticate your request with either\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only),\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0authentication methods.  \nFor simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0or Tweets.  \nTo utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens, specifically the\u00a0[App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)\u00a0(also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify a Tweet  \nWith this endpoint, you must specify the Tweet ID that you want to get liking users for.\u00a0\u00a0You can find the ID of a Tweet by navigating to that Tweet on Twitter and pulling the numerical code at the end of the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is\u00a01354143047324299264.  \nhttps://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1354143047324299264  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this username into the \"Value\" column of the tweet\\_id path variable (at the bottom of the section), making sure to not include any spaces before or after usernames.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | The Tweet ID you want to get the liking users of |  \n####\nStep four:\u00a0Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button after step three, you will receive the default [user object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) fields in your response: id, name, and username.  \nIf you would like to receive additional fields beyond id, name, and username, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/fields)\u00a0and/or [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/expansions)\u00a0parameters.  \nFor this exercise, we will request three additional sets of fields from different objects:  \n1. The additional user.created\\_at field in the primary user objects.\n2. The associated pinned Tweets\u2019 object\u2019s default fields for the returned users: id and text.\n3. The additional\u00a0 tweet.created\\_at field in the associated Tweet objects.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and add the following key:value pair to the \"Query Params\" table:  \n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |\n| user.fields | created\\_at | user.created\\_at |\n| expansions | pinned\\_tweet\\_id | tweet.id, tweet.text |\n| tweet.fields | created\\_at | tweet.created\\_at |  \nYou should now see the following URL next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/1354143047324299264/liking_users?user.fields=created_at&expansions=pinned_tweet_id&tweet.fields=created_at`  \n#### Step five: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"created_at\": \"2008-12-04T18:51:57.000Z\",       \"id\": \"17874544\",       \"username\": \"TwitterSupport\",       \"name\": \"Twitter Support\"     },     {       \"created_at\": \"2007-02-20T14:35:54.000Z\",       \"id\": \"783214\",       \"username\": \"Twitter\",       \"name\": \"Twitter\"     },     {       \"pinned_tweet_id\": \"1389270063807598594\",       \"created_at\": \"2018-11-21T14:24:58.000Z\",       \"id\": \"1065249714214457345\",       \"username\": \"TwitterSpaces\",       \"name\": \"Spaces\"     },     {       \"pinned_tweet_id\": \"1293595870563381249\",       \"created_at\": \"2007-05-23T06:01:13.000Z\",       \"id\": \"6253282\",       \"username\": \"TwitterAPI\",       \"name\": \"Twitter API\"     }   ],   \"includes\": {     \"tweets\": [       {         \"created_at\": \"2021-05-03T17:26:09.000Z\",         \"id\": \"1389270063807598594\",         \"text\": \"now, everyone with 600 or more followers can host a Space.\\n\\nbased on what we've learned, these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting because of their existing audience. before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we\u2019re focused on a few things. \ud83e\uddf5\"       },       {         \"created_at\": \"2020-08-12T17:11:04.000Z\",         \"id\": \"1293595870563381249\",         \"text\": \"Twitter API v2: Early Access released\\n\\nToday we announced Early Access to the first endpoints of the new Twitter API!\\n\\n#TwitterAPI #EarlyAccess #VersionBump https://t.co/g7v3aeIbtQ\"       }     ]   } }`  \n####\nStep six:\u00a0Get a user\u2019s liked Tweets  \nYou might also want to make a request to get a user\u2019s liked Tweets as well. With the Likes lookup endpoint, you can get information about a user\u2019s liked Tweets. To do this navigate to the \"Likes\" folder and select \"Liked Tweets\u201d.  \nWith this endpoint, you must specify the User ID that you want to get liking users for. You can use the [user lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/introduction) endpoint to get this information.  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab and enter this username into the \"Value\" column of the id path variable (at the bottom of the section), making sure to not include any spaces before or after usernames.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| id  | The user ID you want to get the liked Tweets of |\n| max\\_results | 5   |  \nYou can now see a similar URL with your ID instead of TwitterDev\u2019s next to the \"Send\" button:  \n`https://api.twitter.com/2/users/2244994945/liked_tweets?max_results=5`  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:  \n`{   \"data\": [     {       \"id\": \"1362449997430542337\",       \"text\": \"Honored to be the first developer to be featured in @TwitterDev's love fest \ud83e\udd70\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/g8TsPoZsij\"     },     {       \"id\": \"1365416026435854338\",       \"text\": \"We're so happy for our Official Partner @Brandwatch and their big news. https://t.co/3DwWBNSq0o https://t.co/bDUGbgPkKO\"     },     {       \"id\": \"1296487407475462144\",       \"text\": \"Check out this feature on @TwitterDev to learn more about how we're mining social media data to make sense of this evolving #publichealth crisis https://t.co/sIFLXRSvEX.\"     },     {       \"id\": \"1294346980072624128\",       \"text\": \"I awake from five years of slumber https://t.co/OEPVyAFcfB\"     },     {       \"id\": \"1283153843367206912\",       \"text\": \"@wongmjane Wish we could tell you more, but I\u2019m only a teapot \ud83d\udc40\"     }   ],   \"meta\": {         \"next_token\": \"7140dibdnow9c7btw4539n0vybdnx19ylpayqf16fjt4l\",     \t  \"result_count\": 5   } }`\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request using either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code).  \nIn this example, we are going to use OAuth 1.0a User Context.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens \u2013 specifically your API Key, API Secret Key, OAuth 1.0a user Access Token, and OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret \u2013 to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three:\u00a0Specify which Tweet you are going to like  \nManage Likes endpoints require two IDs: one for the user (the user who wishes to like a Tweet), and the other representing the\u00a0 Tweet ID that the user is trying to like or unlike.  \nThe user\u2019s ID must correspond to the authenticating user\u2019s ID, meaning that you must pass the [Access Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) associated with the user ID when authenticating your request.\u00a0 In this case, you can specify the ID belonging to your own user. You can find your ID in two ways:  \n1. Using the [user lookup by username](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference) endpoint, you can pass a username and receive the id field.\n2. Looking at your Access Token, you will find that the numeric part is your user ID.  \nYou also must specify a Tweet that you want to like. You can find the Tweet ID by navigating to twitter.com and clicking on a Tweet and then looking in the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is\u00a01228393702244134912.  \nhttps://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1228393702244134912  \nIn Postman, navigate to the \"Params\" tab, and enter your ID into the \"Value\" column of the id path variable. Navigate to the \u201cBody\u201d tab and ID of the Tweet you wish to like as the value for the tweet\\_id parameter. Be sure not to include any spaces before or after any ID.  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Key** | **Value** |\n| `id` | (your user ID) |\n| tweet\\_id | (the ID of the Tweet you want to like) |  \nIf you click the \"Send\" button, you will receive a response object containing the status of the relationship:  \n* If you receive a \"liked\": true, then the id is successfully liking the tweet\\_id.  \n#### Step four: Make your request and review your response  \nOnce you have everything set up, hit the \"Send\" button and you will receive the following response:  \n`{     \"data\": {         \"liked\": true     } }`  \nIf you wish to unlike the same Tweet you can use the request entitled \u201cUnlike a Tweet\u201d, which is also found in the \u201cLikes\u201d folder of the Twitter API v2 collection in Postman. The id and tweet\\_id should be used in the same way as the previous example.\u00a0 To unlike a Tweet, you will not have to add this as a JSON body so you will want to make sure that you add in the requisite query params for id and tweet\\_id.\n",

To learn how to generate a Bearer Token, see\u00a0[this OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token guide](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only).  \n**Rate limits**  \nThe standard v1.1 GET favorites/list endpoint has a 75 requests per 15 minutes per user rate limit.

The v1.1 GET favorites/list endpoint also allows you to pull all likes of Tweets, but you can pull from 20 to 200 Tweets per request.  \n#### App and Project requirements  \nThe Twitter API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/apps) that is associated with a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/projects) when authenticating your requests. All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.  \n#### Response data format  \nOne of the biggest differences between standard v1.1 and Twitter API v2 endpoint versions is how you select which fields return in your payload.  \nFor the standard endpoints, you receive many of the response fields by default, and then have the option to\u00a0use parameters to identify which fields or sets of fields should return in the payload.  \nThe Twitter API v2 version only delivers the Tweet id and text fields by default. To request any additional fields or objects, you wil need to use the\u00a0[fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields)\u00a0and\u00a0[expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions)\u00a0parameters. Any Tweet fields that you request from these endpoints will return in the primary Tweet object. Any expanded user, media, poll, or place objects and fields will return in an includes object within your response. You can then match any expanded objects back to the Tweet object by matching the IDs located in both the Tweet and the expanded object.  \nWe encourage you to read more about these new parameters in their respective guides, or by reading our guide on [how to use fields and expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/using-fields-and-expansions).  \nWe have also put together a [data format migration guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2) which can help you map standard v1.1 fields to the newer v2 fields. This guide will also provide you the specific expansion and field parameter that you will need to pass with your v2 request to return specific fields.  \nIn addition to the changes in how you request certain fields,\u00a0Twitter API v2 is also introducing new JSON designs for the objects returned by the APIs, including\u00a0[Tweet](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0and\u00a0[user](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user)\u00a0objects.  \n* At the JSON root level, the standard endpoints return Tweet objects in a statuses array, while Twitter API v2 returns a data array.\n* Instead of referring to Retweeted and Quoted \"statuses\", Twitter API v2 JSON refers to Retweeted and Quoted Tweets. Many legacy and deprecated fields, such as\u00a0contributors\u00a0and\u00a0user.translator\\_type\u00a0are being removed.\n* Instead of using both\u00a0favorites\u00a0(in Tweet object) and\u00a0favourites\u00a0(in user object), Twitter API v2 uses the term\u00a0like.\n* Twitter is adopting the convention that JSON values with no value (for example,\u00a0null) are not written to the payload. Tweet and user attributes are only included if they have a non-null values.  \nWe also introduced a new set of fields to the\u00a0[Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)\u00a0including the following:  \n* A\u00a0[conversation\\_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field\n* Two new\u00a0[annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations)\u00a0fields, including\u00a0context\u00a0and\u00a0entities\n* Several new\u00a0[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)\u00a0fields\n* A new reply\\_setting field, which shows you who can reply to a given Tweet  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters accepted two request query parameters (user\\_id or screen\\_name). The Twitter API v2 only accepts the numerical user ID, and it must be passed as part of the endpoint path.\n",

The v1.1 GET favorites/list endpoint also allows you to pull all liked\u00a0 Tweets, but you can pull from 20 to 200 Tweets per request.  \nFor the v2 liking users endpoint, you are limited to 100 liking users per Tweet.  \n#### App and Project requirements  \nThe Twitter API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is associated to a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects)\u00a0when authenticating your requests. All Twitter API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.  \n#### Request parameters  \nThe following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in Twitter API v2:  \n| Standard v1.1 | Twitter API v2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| id  | id  |\n| includes\\_entities | No equivalent |  \nPlease note that the Standard v1.1 parameters are passed as query parameters, whereas the Twitter API v2 parameters are passed as body parameters for the POST endpoint or path parameters for the DELETE endpoint.  \nAlso, an id of the user liking a Tweet is not required when using the standard v1.1 endpoints since the [Access Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) passed with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) infer which user is initiating the like/unlike.\n",

Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our [\"Using Postman\"](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman) page.  \n#### Code samples  \nAre you interested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We\u2019ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).  \n#### Third-party libraries  \nTake advantage of one of our communities\u2019 [third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.\n",

The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are requesting on behalf of. If you want to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using an [Authorize URL](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token).  \nPlease note that OAuth 2.0 can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend using a [library](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests.  \n#### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps  \nTo retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must have a [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal), set up a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App.  \n#### Rate limits  \nEvery day, many thousands of developers make requests to the Twitter API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.  \nThese endpoints are rate limited at the user level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only call the endpoint a certain number of times across any developer App. There is a user rate limit of 180 requests per 15 min window for the GET method.\u00a0With the GET method of the Bookmarks lookup endpoint you will get back 800 of your most recent Bookmarked Tweets. Additionally, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes for the POST and DELETE methods.\n",

Sometimes it\u2019s difficult or overwhelming to do so without help, particularly when people receive a large number of replies, when those replies contain offensive or abusive language, or when they want to confine certain conversations to specific groups like close friends.  \nThis endpoint gives you the ability to programmatically hide or unhide replies using criteria you define. Just like the functionality in the main Twitter experience, replies will be hidden from the main conversation but still visible on a separate page. You can use the endpoint to create apps to help people hide replies they don\u2019t find valuable.  \nThe hide replies endpoint uses either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)\u00a0authentication. If successful, the endpoint hides a single Reply that was published in a Tweet conversation that was initiated by an authenticated user. Each conversation supports hiding up to 725 Tweets.  \n**Account setup**  \nTo access these endpoints, you will need:  \n* An approved\u00a0[developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).\n* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a\u00a0[developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps)\u00a0that is located within a\u00a0[Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).  \nLearn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our\u00a0[getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).  \n[Quick start](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/hide-replies/quick-start)  \n[Jump to example requests](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/hide-replies/api-reference/put-tweets-id-hidden)  \n[Run in Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)  \n[Try with API Explorer](https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=%2F2%2Ftweets%2F%7Bid%7D%2Fhidden&method=put)\n",

To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request using either\u00a0[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)\u00a0or\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code).  \nIn this example, we are going to use OAuth 1.0a User Context.  \nYou must add your keys and tokens \u2013 specifically your API Key, API Secret Key, OAuth 1.0a user Access Token, and OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret \u2013 to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named \u201cTwitter API v2\u201d in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the \"initial value\" and \"current value\" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).  \nThese variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  \n#### Step three: Find a Tweet ID to hide  \nThe hide replies endpoint can hide or unhide replies on behalf of an authorized user. Because we are using the Access Tokens related to your user profile in this example, you will be able to hide replies from users who participate in a conversation started by you.\u00a0Similarly, if you were using Access Tokens that belong to another user that authorized your app,\u00a0you would be able to moderate replies to any conversations started by that account.  \nAsk a friend to reply to a Tweet (let them know you're testing hide replies) or reply to any of your Tweets from a test account. Click on that reply, then copy the numeric part of its URL. That will be the Tweet ID we will hide.  \nIn this case, we will be looking at the following Tweet, which has the ID `1232720193182412800`:  \n`https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1232720193182412800`  \n####\nStep four: Hide the Tweet  \nIn Postman, open the Hide replies folder and select Hide a reply. In the Params tab, paste the Tweet ID next to the\u00a0id\u00a0field (you won't need to replace\u00a0:id\u00a0in the URL). Click \"Send\" and you will see a successful response.  \n`{\"hidden\":true}`  \n#### Step five: Unhide the Tweet  \nHidden Tweets are moved to a separate tab in the Twitter app. To unhide a tweet in Postman, open the Hide replies folder and select Unhide a reply. In the Params tab, paste the same Tweet ID used in the previous step next into the\u00a0id\u00a0field. Click \"Send\" and you will see a successful response.  \n`{\"hidden\":false}`  \nThe hidden field represents the hidden status of the Tweet. A hidden status of true means the Tweet is hidden. Similarly, false means the Tweet is not hidden.\n",

It asks the user\u2019s permission to read their Tweets and manage their replies.\n2. It pulls a recent conversation from a Tweet URL, and checks that the conversation is from the authenticating user.\n3. It will call the recent search endpoint to display each Tweet in the conversation. The request will include a conversation ID search query and the annotation expansion to determine if the Tweet is sports-related or not, according to Twitter's interpretation of the Tweet.\n4. It calls Hide replies to hide a reply when the user chooses to do so. It will also provide a way to undo this action in case, so that the user is always in control.  \n5.

Keeping this principle in mind also helps you build an integration that can optimize for Tweet consumption.  \n1. Because the authenticated user can only manage conversations they started, your flow should terminate early when that's not the case.\n* Make an initial Tweet lookup request. Terminate the flow early if the Tweet URL is not valid or the conversation was not started by the authenticating user.\n* This way, your app doesn't have to make a recent search request if the conversation cannot be moderated by the authenticated user.\n2. Request [user and Tweet fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields.html) in the same request to avoid making separate requests. This approach can also improve your app's performance.\n3. Avoid making requests when needed. This app caches a reply's hidden status in the user's browser. This is useful for larger conversations, where the user may want to pick up their moderation efforts at a later stage, and it helps your app optimize requests to hide or unhide replies.\n",

It uses the\u00a0[Account Activity API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/overview.html)\u00a0to detect incoming replies.\n3. It asks the Perspective API to give a \u201cscore\u201d (a number between 0 and 1) that indicates how confident their algorithm is that a comment is similar to toxic comments it\u2019s seen in the past.

This means your user experience should include controls to undo any action taken by your app on behalf of the user.\n* When using an artificial intelligence, your app should use a very high confidence threshold to detect and hide Tweets.\n* Not everybody uses the same words, and your app should be designed to avoid any bias. Be mindful of reclaimed words and slang that may lead to false positives.\n* If you are training an artificial intelligence, consider adopting a model that closely reflects language often used on Twitter.\n",
