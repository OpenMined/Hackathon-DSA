Use the `post_ids` parameter, specifying one or more post IDs that you obtained from a previous search. See [Guide to Facebook posts data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-fb-posts) and [Guide to Instagram posts data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-ig-posts).  \n* A subset of Instagram personal accounts that match qualification criteria can now be included in results when you search for Instagram account information or for posts from Instagram accounts. Public Instagram accounts include professional accounts for businesses and creators. They now also include a subset of personal accounts that have account privacy set to public and have either a verified badge or 50,000 or more followers. A verified badge in this context refers to accounts confirmed as authentic and not those with a paid Meta Verified subscription. See [Guide to Instagram accounts data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-ig-accounts) and [Guide to Instagram posts data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-ig-posts).  \n* You can now filter posts from Facebook Pages by the page admin\u2019s location country. Set the new `admin_countries` parameter to include one or more country codes of your choice. See [Guide to Facebook posts data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-fb-posts).  \n* Multimedia (photos and videos) can now be included in search post results for both Instagram and Facebook.

See [Data dictionary](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/data#dd-fb-post) for descriptions of all available fields. |\n| `POST_IDS`  <br>_Optional_ | List | Comma-separated list of Meta Content Library post IDs as strings. Limits the query to posts in the list. Maximum of 250 IDs. |\n| `PAGE_IDS`  <br>_Optional_ | List | Comma-separated list of Meta Content Library Page IDs as strings. Limits the query to posts from Pages in the list. Maximum of 250 IDs. |\n| `GROUP_IDS`  <br>_Optional_ | List | Comma-separated list of Meta Content Library group IDs as strings.

Limits the query to posts from events in the list. Maximum of 250 IDs. |\n| `LANG`  <br>_Optional_ | String | The content languages of the Facebook posts to include, specified as ISO 639-1 language codes in 2-letter lowercase format. Multiple languages are comma-separated either in a single string (`lang=\"ru,es\"`) or in an array (`lang=[\"ru\" \"es\"]`). |\n| `LINK`  <br>_Optional with the `q` parameter_ | String | Posts containing the specified URL are included in search results. All forms of the URL that point to the same piece of content will be returned.<br><br>  <br><br>Usage:<br><br>* Can only be used with the `q` parameter.<br>* Returns posts from exact matches only.<br>* Searching for multiple URLs in one query is not supported.<br><br>**If you want to search all posts from a domain, the `link` parameter is not the best option since it returns posts from exact matches only.**<br><br>Instead, you can use the `q` parameter where q=_url_.

The search results will include the ID field by default (you don't have to specify it in your query). See [Guides](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guides) to learn about these methods.  \nThe IDs that are displayed in the search results are Meta Content Library IDs that protect user privacy and will not match the IDs of the content on Meta platforms. These Meta Content Library IDs are the ones you use in your subsequent post searches.  \nTo search for posts from specific Pages, groups, or events, create a search object using the `search_posts()` method with the `page_ids`, `group_ids`, or `event_ids` parameter, and with or without the `q` parameter. `q` is not required but can be added to further filter posts. It does not matter when the posts were created. If you omit the `q` parameter, all public posts on the specified Pages, groups, or events are returned.  \nRPython\n",

The retrieval function combines matched and ranked IDs from a query using the same distributed [memory caching layer](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2013%2F06%2F25%2Fcore-data%2Ftao-the-power-of-the-graph%2F&h=AT1qjsyCfu7oKiwR7oD7250UOC5Sd14-ieuau-hKBvw8ihrsyVgrnEgA0EB9a_P6uYFJFNOtPDFvwp5XPqKRPkspRQg7-voKD0v2hAJAWWG2DdAxIJgw4c8v7VKsYunYv4TY1O3S3PkQSrHM) which serves live platform content. This ensures that results represent the most current state of content on the platform and meet privacy-preserving visibility criteria (see [Frequently asked questions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/disclosures) for details).  \nAs content is created or modified on Meta platforms, associated entities are registered to a search index built from individual words extracted from text fields as _tokens_. Tokenization generally isolates words separated by spaces or punctuation ( ?@$%^\\*()+=~\\[{}\\];:\"<>|. ), with some URL normalization and locale-specific adjustments for non-English languages. Tokenization is exact, in that it does not introduce additional word variants (\"cats\" will not be tokenized to \"cat\"). Direct mentions of users or other platform entities (via @) are not tokenized and are scrubbed from returned text fields, and are thus not searchable.  \nAt query time, relevant content is identified by exact matching between tokens and individual search terms. Candidate matches are then subject to additional filtering via Boolean query logic (see [Advanced search guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search)) and other selected filters. Matching is performed independently by word in a query, meaning that searching by phrase is not supported (queries \u201cAll for one\u201d and \u201cOne for all\u201d are equivalent).\n",

Each search object specifies the search method to be used and sets the values of the parameters that determine which data will be returned.  \nThe parameters accepted by each search method are described in the search method [guides](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guides).  \nThe following sections describe how to use search objects to achieve various objectives, providing query examples in both R and Python.  \n* [Basic synchronous search with paginated results](#sync-search)  \n* [Response formats](#res-formats)  \n* [Altering search parameters](#alter-search)  \n* [Asynchronous search](#async-search)  \n* [Estimating response size](#estimate)\n",

Synchronous search results display 10 results at a time (a \"page\") and you request the next pages one by one. This type of search is most useful when the data matching the search criteria is expected to be small or when you just want to sample some results to see if they are appropriate for your research and don't necessarily need to see everything. This can be a step in the process of fine-tuning your search criteria.  \nSynchronous searches can return a maximum of 1000 results. When you need a larger set of results, use [asynchronous searches](#async-search).  \nRPython  \n#Import the client library if you have not already done so:\nlibrary(contentlibraryapi)\nclient <- ContentLibraryAPIClient$new(version='2')\n",

Asynchronous searches can take some time (minutes to days) to complete because they return all of the data requested, not just one page at a time. However, because the search happens in the background, you don't have to wait for the results before submitting another search or doing other work. Once the search results are ready, you can fetch them.  \nThe search result limit for each asynchronous search is 100,000 results. See [Estimating response size](#estimate).  \nResearcher Platform also has an asynchronous search feature, but that is strictly for static database use and does not work the same way. With Content Library API, you can only use the `async_search()` method described here.  \nWhen you submit an asynchronous search, the API returns \"True\" indicating the successful submission of the asynchronous query if the expected results are below the 100,000 search results limit, and an error message if the expected results are over the limit.  \nIf the search is successfully submitted, you can check on the status and receive either IN\\_PROGRESS or COMPLETE.  \nUse the `submit_async_query()` method with `async_status`:  \nRPython\n",

Since the API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large. If the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed.  \nThis is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the size of data that would be returned by any search.  \nRPython\n",

See [Estimating response size](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#estimate) and [Asynchrounous search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#async-search) in the _Search Guide_ for more information on these topics.  \n**Points to keep in mind**:  \n* The API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, so it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large.  \n* The query budget of 500,000 results in a rolling seven-day window can be used up quickly on just a few searches with high predicted results.  \nIf the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, you might consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed or close to the response size you prefer.  \nThis is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the number of results that would be returned by any search.  \nRPython\n",

See [Estimating response size](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#estimate) and [Asynchrounous search](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/guide-search-object#async-search) in the _Search Guide_ for more information on these topics.  \n**Points to keep in mind**:  \n* The API can only return up to 100,000 results from a single asynchronous search, so it can be helpful to know in advance if your search is likely to fail because the response size is too large.  \n* The query budget of 500,000 results in a rolling seven-day window can be used up quickly on just a few searches with high predicted results.  \nIf the estimate comes out higher than 100,000, you might consider modifying the parameters to reduce the response size. You can continue to modify the search parameters and get new estimates until the search results are predicted to fall below the maximum allowed or close to the response size you prefer.  \nThis is typically most useful for post searches because the number of results tend to be higher, but it can be used to estimate the number of results that would be returned by any search.  \nRPython\n",

The retrieval function combines matched and ranked IDs from a query using the same distributed [memory caching layer](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2013%2F06%2F25%2Fcore-data%2Ftao-the-power-of-the-graph%2F&h=AT1-Q7Wgi5KB4QxoLpmG2GlumDaDJaFx-Gy4AGLKCweWro_nv71laUM-gb4OHWV8kv9t0ThHlPx8T-qY162Or5GqbNhyBSRrjmGQu5qDDKIFEGD_cc-uyOs2xAeRrRTyZi5Yy2wUs4CqPANp) which serves live platform content. This ensures that results represent the most current state of content on the platform and meet privacy-preserving visibility criteria (see [Frequently asked questions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/disclosures) for details).  \nAs content is created or modified on Meta platforms, associated entities are registered to a search index built from individual words extracted from text fields as _tokens_. Tokenization generally isolates words separated by spaces or punctuation ( ?@$%^\\*()+=~\\[{}\\];:\"<>|. ), with some URL normalization and locale-specific adjustments for non-English languages. Tokenization is exact, in that it does not introduce additional word variants (\"cats\" will not be tokenized to \"cat\"). Direct mentions of users or other platform entities (via @) are not tokenized and are scrubbed from returned text fields, and are thus not searchable.  \nAt query time, relevant content is identified by exact matching between tokens and individual search terms. Candidate matches are then subject to additional filtering via Boolean query logic (see [Advanced search guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/content-library-api/adv-search)) and other selected filters. Matching is performed independently by word in a query, meaning that searching by phrase is not supported (queries \u201cAll for one\u201d and \u201cOne for all\u201d are equivalent).\n",

These initial test queries consisted of single terms all in English without non-Latin characters or any symbols (for example \u2018, #, $ or @). Additional query parameters for each endpoint are listed in [Test search scope for endpoints](#scope). Test queries resulting in > 100,000 results were excluded from further analysis.  \n#### Validation data  \nLists of expected entities for test queries were generated from regex-based full-text searches on a SQL-like database backend. Tables in this database are built from periodic snapshots of logged platform content and thus are known to differ slightly from what is available in Meta Content Library and API at search time due to time lags and incomplete visibility filters. This dataset thus constitutes a secondary validation channel rather than source of truth and regressions in quality metrics may be a composite of both true indexing errors and/or measurement noise.

We measured representativeness using a series of statistical tests for bias at the individual query level.  \n#### Query-level bias  \nFor each test query we compared whether a summary statistic (mean, for example) calculated using the results from the Meta Content Library API reasonably approximated results obtained from the validation dataset (which has high recall). Across several data dimensions including engagement, exposure, and creator demographics, we performed a series of t-tests comparing means derived from the Meta Content Library API to means derived from the validation dataset. We then calculated the percent of queries which lacked statistically significant evidence of bias (p > 0.05). Finally, we calculated the mean of metrics across all dimensions.  \nWe performed two versions of this test using methods which differed in their level of sensitivity to small differences between Meta Content Library API results and validation data. In the first version, we used a Welch\u2019s T-test, which is appropriate for detecting major distributional differences between datasets that might affect inference about population-level traits. It is less sensitive to small differences between datasets and we expect most appropriate for research use cases involving trends and summaries.  \nThe following table shows average daily percent of test queries generating non-biased results using a Welch\u2019s T-test across endpoints from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.  \n| Endpoint | Representativeness - Welch t-test |\n| --- | --- |\n| Facebook Page | 96% |\n| Facebook group | 86% |\n| Facebook event | 78% |\n| Facebook post | 86% |\n| Instagram account | 97% |\n| Instagram post | 96% |  \nIn the second version of the query-level bias test we compared Meta Content Library API and validation datasets using a pairwise t-test (incorporating covariance between samples). This test is more powered to detect differences between datasets and appropriate for assessing whether small subsets of entities may be missing or over-represented. For instance, this metric could highlight significant bias even with 98% recall and a negligible difference in means, due to any imbalance in the remaining data. Given known issues with the validation dataset failing to exclude some ineligible entities based on visibility criteria, we expect these measures to be more conservative and likely underestimates of representativeness.  \nThe following table shows percent of test queries generating non-biased results using a paired t-test across endpoints from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.  \n| Endpoint | Representativeness - paired t-test |\n| --- | --- |\n| Facebook Page | 80% |\n| Facebook group | 54% |\n| Facebook event | 41% |\n| Facebook post | 53% |\n| Instagram account | 74% |\n| Instagram post | 64% |\n",

These languages were selected based on the language features that the team believe are most likely to impact search quality. The features that the team considered are diacritics (such as accents), non-Roman characters, and right-to-left. We also wanted to cover at least one non-English European language.  \nBased on the analysis, we learned:  \n* The overall search quality of all the new languages is about the same level as English single keywords.  \n* The precision is over 95% for all endpoints in new languages.  \n* Since the search quality is reasonable for these languages, we expect to see very similar results for most other languages too.  \nThe following table shows all metric values across test queries by language and endpoint from November 8th, 2023 to November 15th, 2023.

The limitations are as follows:  \n* Meta Content Library API does not read any keywords with \u201c\u00df\u201d in German or semi-space (half-space) in Arabic.  \n* In Arabic, a word can be written with and without diacritics. Content Library API can only find the exact match for each form. Thus, if a researcher wants to find all posts related to that keyword, they have to search all forms of those keywords to get full results. For example, if a researcher need to find all post related to term \u0645\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0631, they need to search \u0645\u064f\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0631 or \u0645\u064f\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0631 or \u0645\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0631 or \u0645\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0631 to get all the results.\n",

There may also occasionally be short lags between when content is created or modified and when it is indexed.  \n#### Why am I not seeing an entity I can find on the platform?  \nApart from coverage gaps or delivery issues mentioned below (see [Factors affecting recall](#recallfactors)), it is possible the content is not eligible to be visible in the Meta Content Library and API. The visibility rules for content are complex and constantly evolving with new policies and regulations, making it possible that some content could be theoretically viewed by an individual on platform but not exposed via the Meta Content Library and API. For instance, visibility of some content is geographically restricted to users from the country where the content was produced. Also, direct mentions (via @) are not searchable, meaning that a result will not be returned if a matching term is only found in a direct mention.  \n#### Why would a search result not match my query?  \nApart from tokenization issues listed below (see [Factors affecting precision](#precisionfactors)), it is possible that the content actually does contain the search terms, but they are found in different text fields or far apart within the text. Search matches query terms independently and scans all text fields visible from the UI. It also does not support phrase searching. Thus a search for \u201cWalter Payton\u201d could match a page listing basketball players \u201cWalter Williams\u201d and \u201cGary Payton\u201d without reference to a \u201cWalter Payton\u201d anywhere in the text.\n",

In our tests, we have found that the validation dataset may occasionally include non-eligible entities for a given search term due to lags between real-time content visibility and privacy status and their representation in the databases used for validation (see validation data presented earlier). This means that true recall estimates are likely underestimated.  \n* Edge cases or gaps in coverage (true negatives). Indexing data at the scale which Meta operates means that occasionally some content may be imperfectly indexed or missed. Furthermore, internal data models may change, such as when new features for creating and sharing content on platform are added. Thus there may be a lag between when content is available on platform and when it is indexed. As we improve and scale the product, we appreciate any reported cases of missing data from search (see [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details).  \n* Asynchronous delivery issues. The Meta Content Library and API\u2019s entity loading mechanisms are complex and memory-intensive at scale. Occasionally, the loading process for an entity can become too memory-intensive and fail, resulting in the exclusion of that entity from the returned results.\n",

Precision is checked using basic regular expression searches with strict definitions of word boundaries. However tokenization may be more flexible, especially with different language localizations, text involving unicode, URLs, and other patterns. The existence of these edge cases means that precision will be under-estimated to some extent.  \n* The search term was tokenized in a context-specific way. Occasionally words with unicode symbols, non-English characters, accent marks or URLs may be tokenized in a form that differs from its presented value. For instance, the content with the French word `congr\u00e9gation` may be returned for a query on the English word `congregation`, despite the literal difference between the acute accented e and its English counterpart.  \n* The index has matched text not returned by the Meta Content Library or API. In some cases, content with complex, nested data models such as reshares may contain text fields that are tokenized and indexed but not returned by the Meta Content Library or API. We appreciate user feedback identifying such cases (see [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details).  \n* For the Facebook posts endpoint, there is a known issue involving post reshare text being indexed but not returned in the Meta Content Library API. These posts may either have no visible text (since they are reshares), or the text returned may not contain any mention of the query term. We are exploring this issue further.\n",

In these cases there is a population of entities which are either (a) not returned by the Meta Content Library API due to gaps in indexing / delivery, or (b) incorrectly included in the validation dataset adding noise to the calculation. If these groups of entities have similar properties along the data dimensions tested they can influence the representativeness metrics  \n* The per-query bias test uses a probabilistic statistical test which uses an alpha = 0.05 cutoff by convention. Thus for each test term there is a 5% probability that the test will be a false positive (Type I error rate).\n",
