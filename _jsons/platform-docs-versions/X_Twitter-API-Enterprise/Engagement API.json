To use this API, you must first set up an account with our enterprise sales team.\u00a0[Learn more](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise)_  \nThe Engagement API provides access to Tweet impression and engagement metrics. While most metrics and endpoints require you to authenticate using [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), you can access public Favorite, Retweet, Reply, and Video Views metrics using\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) and the /totals endpoint.  \n**Note:** You may observe differences between reported data on some of the Twitter web dashboards, and the data reported in the Engagement API. These differences occur because the web dashboards typically only show engagements and/or impressions that occurred within the selected time range. For example, a web dashboard may show engagement on Tweets within the span of a calendar month, while the Engagement API may show engagements that fall beyond the span of that month, but within the time range requested. The Engagement API should be seen as the valid source, in these cases.\n",

We\u2019ll start off by discussing the \u2018whys\u2019 of integrating, then start digging into the technical \u2018how\u2019 details.  \n#### What does the Engagement API provide?  \n* The Engagement API provides impression and engagement data for any Twitter account\u2019s owned Tweets from the last 90 days, assuming that account has authorized your App to request metrics on their behalf using [3-legged OAuth](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens). This powerful, yet easy-to-implement solution gives immediate access to impressions and deep engagements such as URL clicks, #hashtag clicks, and many more.\n* The Engagement API provides total aggregate metrics for favorites, Retweets, Quote Tweets, replies, and video views views for any Tweet. This can be used as a powerful way to get basic engagement data about any Tweet or collection of Tweets.\n* The Engagement API delivers new value to social listening, marketing, and publishing platforms by allowing customers to measure ROI on Twitter by effectively measuring the performance of content using 15+\u00a0performance metrics.\n* The Engagement API is a request/response API that allows app developers to send requests with Tweet IDs, desired metrics, and a time frame, for which the API instantly returns data.  \n#### Why integrate? Example use-cases  \n* Understand the total reach of your content to see how many people view it. See how many people view videos, click on links, click on hashtags, or install my apps.\n* Generate both total and time-series engagement metrics.\n* Understand basic engagement metrics (favorites, Retweets, Quote Tweets, replies) about any public Tweet.\n* Use these metrics to determine what types of Tweets work so I can post them more often and get more impressions and more engagements for my content.\n* Automate marketing behavior (such as Retweeting content from a different owned account) every time one of my Tweets reaches 100 Likes, or another threshold.\n* Benchmark and compare my campaigns against each other as a tool for A/B testing.\n* Analyze what type of content resonates for my customer service department to determine how and when to respond.\n* Show analytics for content that is published from my platform.  \nThe [Engagement API was launched in 2016](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2016/gnip-s-engagement-api-is-now-generally-available.html) and was the first Twitter API to provide these in-depth engagement metrics at scale. The Engagement API is easy to use and enables customers to automate the process. Here is a case study describing an example integration:  \n* [Measuring campaign success with the Red Cross](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/spotlight/2016/measuring-campaign-success-with-the-red-cross.html)[](https://simplymeasured.com/blog/true-twitter-impressions-and-url-clicks-new-from-simply-measured/#sm.0007werel134td8zqf02m2mduumr6)  \nNow that we\u2019ve explored the \u2018whys\u2019 of the Engagement API, let\u2019s start digging into the technical details.\n",

Requests consist three main parts (follow links for more documentation):  \n* Array of **_Tweet IDs_**.\n* Array specifying the [metric types](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/overview.html#EngagementTypes) of interest. Types include things such as \u2018impressions\u2019, \u2018retweets\u2019, \u2018hashtag\\_clicks\u2019, and \u2018user\\_follows\u2019.\n* [Engagement groupings](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/guides/grouping-results), which is a JSON structure indicating how you want the engagement data arranged in the API response.  \nIn many situations, the Engagement Types and Groupings will remains relatively constant from request to request, with only the Tweet IDs being updated.  \nThe Engagement API provides [three endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/overview.html#RequestEndpoints):  \n* **Totals** - Provides grand totals of engagements for Tweets. Some metrics are available for all Tweets, while others are only available for the past 90 days.\n* **28 hour** - Provides time-series engagement metrics from the last 28 hours.\n* **Historical** - Provides time-series engagement metrics for up to four consecutive weeks for Tweets posted since September 1, 2014.  \nThe **/totals** endpoint supports requesting metrics for up to **250 Tweets per request**. The **/28hour** and **/historical** endpoints support **25 per request**.  \nAfter discussing getting access to the Engagement API, we\u2019ll walk through making an API request, provide an OAuth overview, and provide links to other technical resources.  \n#### Getting API access  \nIf you are reading this document, you have most likely already obtained access to the Engagement API. If not, please reach out to your Enterprise account manager, or apply for Enterprise access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/enterprise-application).  \nThe first step is creating a [Twitter app](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps)\u00a0using an approved developer account via the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/overview). \u00a0Your account manager will need the numeric App ID associated with this application to provide access. If you need to apply for a developer account, you can do so [here](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/apply).  \n#### Making a request  \nThe good news is that making requests to the Engagement API is simple. For our request, we\u2019ll ask it for total Retweets, Quote Tweets, Favorites, and replies, for the following two [@TwitterDev](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev) Tweets:  \n> 1/ Today we\u2019re sharing our vision for the future of the Twitter API platform![https://t.co/XweGngmxlP](https://t.co/XweGngmxlP)\n>\n> \u2014 Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) [April 6, 2017](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/850006245121695744)  \n> Don\u2019t miss the Tweets about your Tweet.\n>\n> Now on iOS, you can see Retweets with comments all in one place. [pic.twitter.com/oanjZfzC6y](https://t.co/oanjZfzC6y)\n>\n> \u2014 Twitter (@Twitter) [May 12, 2020](https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1260294888811347969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \nThe first step is constructing the API request in JSON, consisting of these two Tweet IDs placed in an array, an array of engagement types of interest, and a custom-named \u201cgroupings\u201d JSON object that indicates how we want the metrics arranged in the response. Here is what our request looks like:  \n`{   \"tweet_ids\": [     1260294888811347969, 850006245121695744   ],   \"engagement_types\": [     \"retweets\", \"quote_tweets\", \"favorites\", \"replies\"   ],   \"groupings\": {     \"engagement-types-by-id\": {       \"group_by\": [         \"Tweet.id\", \"engagement.type\"       ]     }   } }`  \nTo retrieve these total metrics, we POST this JSON request to the https://data-api.twitter.com/insights/engagement/totals endpoint.  \nWe\u2019ll include the following headers to indicate that our request is encoded in JSON, and that it is Gzipped (request bodies can get big):  \n* Content-Type: application/json\n* Accept-Encoding: gzip  \nWhen making requests we authenticate using OAuth, which we\u2019ll discuss more in the next section.  \nThe API returns the following payload:  \n`{   \"grouping name\": {     \"1260294888811347969\": {       \"favorites\": \"17111\",       \"quote_tweets\": \"3254\",       \"replies\": \"1828\",       \"retweets\": \"5218\"     },     \"850006245121695744\": {       \"favorites\": \"492\",       \"quote_tweets\": \"66\",       \"replies\": \"42\",       \"retweets\": \"324\"     }   } }`  \nNote that the response has our requested metrics in the structure described by the \u201cgroupings\u201d definitions, with metrics listed by Tweet ID first, then by engagement type on the next level.  \nThat was pretty simple. If you are new to authenticating with OAuth, check out the next section.\n",

If you are new to OAuth, please visit our [Oauth with the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth.html) page or head directly to the\u00a0[https://oauth.net](https://oauth.net/) to learn more. Then we recommend that you find an OAuth package for your integration language of choice and start there. With these packages, the path to authenticating typically means configuring your keys and tokens, creating some sort of HTTP object, then making requests with that object.  \nFor example, in the Ruby world, the following pseudo-code represents a recipe to build an OAuth-enabled app using the Ruby gem \u2018oauth\u2019 and making a POST request:  \n`require 'oauth'  #Assemble JSON request (as above). request = make_json_request()   #Build an app consumer object with my app consumer key and secret. consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new(keys['consumer_key'], keys['consumer_secret'], {:site => \u2018https://data-api.twitter.com\u2019}) #Build a user token with tokens provided by account providing permission. If making app-only #request (checking Tweets that do not require permission with /totals endpoint), this step can be #skipped.  token = {:oauth_token => keys['access_token'], :oauth_token_secret => keys['access_token_secret']}  #Create oauth-enabled app object.  app = OAuth::AccessToken.from_hash(consumer, token) #Make POST request. result = app.post(\u201c/insights/engagement/totals\", request, {\"content-type\" => \"application/json\", \"Accept-Encoding\" => \"gzip\"})`  \nThe Engagement API supports both application-only and user-context authentication.\u00a0If you are collecting engagement metrics for unowned public Tweets with the /totals endpoint then no user permission is required and you can use application-only authentication. In this case, you\u2019ll use only your app key and secret to authenticate.  \nOAuth also allows an app to make an API request \u201con behalf of another user\u201d, using tokens that relate to the user. If you are generating Engagement metrics for owned Tweets, ie Tweets that were published by a user whom you have user tokens for, you will be making requests with a user context, meaning authenticating with both your app keys and user-specific access tokens. These user access tokens are typically supplied with the '[Sign-in with Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/log-in-with-twitter/login-in-with-twitter)'\u00a0process or acquired directly from the user (please note that you must use [twurl](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/using-twurl) if you acquire the tokens directly from the user). Once the user provides their tokens, they do not expire and can be used with the Engagement API to make requests on their behalf, \u00a0as long as the user doesn't reset their tokens or change their password, in which case they will have to provide you the new tokens.  \nYou can review which metrics require which authentication via\u00a0[this table](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/overview#EngagementTypes).\n",

Some metrics are available for all Tweets, while others are only available for Tweets published in the last 90 days. Supports 250 Tweets per request.\n* **[28 hour](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#28hr)** - provides time-series Engagement metrics for \u2018owned\u2019 Tweets from the last 28 hours. Supports 25 Tweets per request.\n* **[Historical](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#Historical)** \\- provides time-series Engagement metrics for up to four consecutive weeks for \u2018owned\u2019 Tweets posted since September 1, 2014. Supports 25 Tweets per request.  \nEach endpoint has its own unique characteristics. Whether you are planning to use all three, or are trying to decide which one best matches your use case, it\u2019s important to understand the differences between them.  \nBelow we introduce some key concepts, further explore the three endpoints, and then present example use cases that map generally to a specific endpoint. Our hope is that this information will help you more efficiently integrate all three, or help you decide which single endpoint best fits your mission.\n",

Impressions generated from Tweets that are seen in a Promoted or Paid context are not included. Before the Engagement API, Tweet impressions represented only a measure of potential views. It was based on counting followers of the author\u2019s account and those of any account Retweeting the content. It did not take into account the common situation when a given user does not actually see the Tweet.  \nThe impression metrics generated by the Engagement API is an actual measure of the number of times a Tweet has been rendered for display. If a follower of your account misses your Tweet, it does not count as an impression.  \nThe Engagement API provides metrics on 14 unique engagement\u00a0[metric types](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/overview#EngagementTypes), each representing a distinct action a user can take when presented a Tweet. These include Retweeting, Liking, Replying, clicking on entities like #hashtags, links and media, following the author, and viewing the author\u2019s profile. All of these individual actions are rolled up into a single Engagements metric.  \n#### Owned and unowned Twitter content  \nThe Engagement makes a clear distinction between owned and unowned Tweets. Owned Tweets are Tweets that are posted from your account, or Tweets that you have obtained permission to request Engagement data for. As with other Twitter APIs, you obtain permission by having other Twitter users/accounts share access tokens that enable you to make API requests on their behalf. A common way to obtain these tokens is with the [\u2018Sign in with Twitter\u2019 process](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/log-in-with-twitter/login-in-with-twitter).  \nThe /totals endpoint provides engagement data for both owned and unowned Tweets. For unowned Tweets, you can request engagement metrics that are publicly available in a Tweet display: Favorite, Retweet, and Reply. For these metrics, what the Engagement API brings to the table is the ability to retrieve these metrics at scale in an automated way. For owned Tweets, the /totals endpoint also provides Impression and (total) Engagement metrics.  \nThe /28hr and /historical endpoints provide metrics for owned Tweets only, meaning that you have to pass along user context when making the request to these endpoints.  \n#### Total and time-series engagement Data  \nThe /totals endpoint provides, as its name implies, only grand totals for its engagement types. Its numbers represent the up-to-date totals since the Tweet was posted. If a Tweet was just posted and you repeatedly request its metrics, these totals will commonly change with each request.  \nThe /28hr and /historical endpoints can provide both grand totals and time-series data. When requesting time-series data, the engagement metrics can be rolled up into daily or hourly data.  \nSee our documentation on [engagement groupings](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/guides/grouping-results) for how to request time-series data with the /28hr and /historical endpoints.\n",

To this end, make sure to share the App ID that you intend to use for authentication purposes with your account manager or technical support team.  \nThere are two authentication methods available with the Engagement API: [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/authenticating-with-twitter-api-for-enterprise/authentication-method-overview#oauth1.0a)\u00a0and\u00a0[OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/authenticating-with-twitter-api-for-enterprise/authentication-method-overview#oauth2.0).  \n**OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token** (also referred to as \u201capplication-only\u201d) allows you to access publicly available engagement metrics. This authentication method can be used to get total counts for Favorites (aka Likes), Retweets, Quote Tweets, Replies, and video views for any publicly available Tweets when making requests to the [/totals endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/engagement-api/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#Totals).  \n**OAuth 1.0a** (also referred to as \u201cuser context\u201d) allows you to make requests on behalf of a user and access private engagement metrics that belong to the user in question.  \nThis authentication method is required for:  \n* All requests sent to the [/28hr endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/engagement-api/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#api-28hr) and [/historical endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/engagement-api/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#Historical)\n* Accessing any of the following private metrics: Impressions, Engagements, Media Views, Media Engagements, URL Clicks, Hashtag Clicks, Detail Expands, Permalink Clicks, App Install Attempts, App Opens, Email Tweet, User Follows, and User Profile Clicks  \nWhen sending a request with OAuth 1.0a, you need to include the Access Tokens (Access Token and Secret) of the user who owns the Tweet or protected resource of interest. If you do not provide the correct user Access Tokens when requesting protected user data, the Engagement API will return a `403 Forbidden` error.  \nThe Engagement API will not allow you to fetch engagement data for [protected Tweets](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets), even if you are authenticating on behalf of the user who owns these Tweets. Attempting to do so will return a `400 Bad Request` error, with the message `\"Tweet ID(s) are unavailable\"`.  \nIf you are sending a request on behalf of your own Twitter account (in other words, the account that owns the developer App), you can generate the required Access Tokens directly from within the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps), under the \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d tab for the developer App.  \nIf you are making a request on behalf of any other user, you will need to use the 3-legged OAuth flow to obtain the required Access Tokens. The following documentation contains more information on how to do this: [OAuth 1.0a: how to obtain a user\u2019s access tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/authenticating-with-twitter-api-for-enterprise/oauth1-0a-and-user-access-tokens).  \nFor additional examples, including how to authenticate using OAuth 1.0a, check out [TwitterDev\u2019s sample Python code for the Engagement API](https://github.com/twitterdev/enterprise-scripts-python/tree/master/Engagement-API).\n",

In our continual effort to enable marketing decisions based on our data, we are excited to share recent changes to the Engagement API that provide greater consistency with metrics across all of Twitter.  \nWe recently deployed changes to modernize the Engagement API to use the same metrics aggregation methodology in use by the Twitter analytics dashboard (analytics.twitter.com). We took a thoughtful approach to try and minimize breaking API changes when rolling out these new metrics and deployed the first set of changes on October 9, 2017. These changes improve consistency from all of the places you or your customers might monitor your performance on Twitter. Please see the detailed outline of the changes below:  \n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Metric** | **Change** |\n| engagements | We\u2019ve updated the metrics that roll into overall engagements to match consistency with the Tweet analytics dashboard. Engagements measures \u201ctimes people interacted with this Tweet\u201d.<br><br>For Tweets that include media like a video or a GIF, the engagements metric will no longer include media views. Media views can now be accessed in a new metric, _media\\_views_. |\n| media\\_clicks\\* | This metric has been replaced by a new metric called \u201c_media\\_engagements_\u201d. |\n| video\\_views | As of July 6th, 2018, this metric is now available for 'unowned' Tweets via the [/totals](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#Totals) endpoint. This means that you can access the video views for **all** Tweets by using app-only authentication.\u00a0<br><br>You can only request video views that are younger than 1800 days old. If you try to request video views for a Tweet older than 1800 days, you will receive the following:<br><br>\"unsupported\\_for\\_video\\_views\\_tweet\\_ids\": \\[\"TWEET\\_ID\"\\]<br><br>**Please note** that it will differ from media\\_views in that video\\_views relies on the MRC standard of 50% of the video in view for at least two seconds.  <br><br>**Also,** note that you may see a discrepancy between the video views metric displayed in the Twitter owned and operated platforms (mobile app and website) and the number that you receive via the /28hr and /historical endpoints.<br><br>* The video views displayed in the Twitter user interface and that delivers using the /totals endpoint will display the video view aggregated across all Tweets in which the given video has been posted. That means that the metric displayed in the UI includes the combined views from any instance where the video has been Retweeted or reposted in separate Tweets.<br>* The video views provided by the /28hr and /historical endpoints will just include those views generated by the specific Tweet for which you are pulling metrics. |\n| media\\_views | This includes all views (autoplay and click) of your media counted across videos, vines, gifs, and images.<br><br>**Please note** that Tweets with images do not show a media\\_views metric in the analytics dashboard but will be returned in the Engagement API. |\n| media\\_engagements\\* | This includes the number of clicks on your media across videos, vines, gifs, and images. This metric is replacing _media\\_clicks_. |\n| quote\\_tweets | As of July 7th, 2020, this metric is now available for 'unowned' Tweets via the /totals endpoint. This means that you can access the Quote Tweet count for all Tweets by using app-only authentication. |\n",

These differences occur because the web dashboards typically only show engagements and/or impressions that occurred within the selected time range. For example, a web dashboard may show engagement on Tweets within the span of a calendar month, while the Engagement API may show engagements that fall beyond the span of that month, but within the time range requested. The Engagement API should be seen as the valid source, in these cases.\n",

Impressions generated from Tweets that are seen in a Promoted or Paid context are **not** included.  \nEngagements represent the number of times that a given Tweet was engaged upon by a viewer in both an **organic** and **promoted** context. Engagements include, but are not limited to, Retweets, Favorites, Replies, URL Clicks, Hashtag Clicks, Mention Clicks, and Media Views. For the full list of included engagement actions, please see the Engagement Data section.  \nIn order to calculate a baseline engagement rate, please use the total number of engagements divided by the total number of impressions for a given Tweet for the time period you are analyzing.  \nImpression and engagement data can only be retrieved for Tweets from owned @handles, or @handles that have authorized your application to view details about their Tweets.\u00a0 Internally, the Engagement API will track the number of unique @handles that have been requested against the contracted @handle limit.\u00a0 It's recommended to also track the @handle request usage on the client side throughout the month.\n",

The first of which is our video views metric, which relies on the MRC standard of 50% of the video in view for at least two seconds. The second is Media Views, that includes all views (autoplay and click) of your media counted across videos, vines, gifs, and images.  \nThe video views metric is available for owned Tweets via the /28hour and /historical endpoints, as well as for all unowned Tweets via the /totals endpoint.  \nWhile the video views metric within the Twitter user interface is using the same MRC standard, please note that you may see a discrepancy between the video views metric displayed in the Twitter owned and operated platforms (mobile app and website) and the number that you receive via the different Engagement API endpoints.  \n* The video views provided by the /totals endpoint and the Twitter user interface will display the video view aggregated across all Tweets in which the given video has been posted. That means that the metric delivered via /totals and displayed in the Twitter UI includes the combined views from any instance where the video has been Retweeted or reposted in separate Tweets.\n* The video views provided by the /28hour and /historical Engagement API endpoints will just include those views generated by the specific Tweet for which you are pulling metrics.  \nPlease note that we do not deliver video views for Tweets that are older than 1800 days. Instead, we deliver an object that lists the Tweets that are older than 1800 days. You will still receive all other metrics for your requested Tweets in a separate object. Here is an example response:  \n`{   \"unsupported_for_video_views_tweet_ids\": [     \"479311209565413376\",     \"477139122520219648\"   ],   \"grouping name\": {     \"479311209565413376\": {       \"favorites\": \"69\",       \"impressions\": \"1692\",       \"retweets\": \"142\",       \"video_views\": \"0\"     },     \"477139122520219648\": {       \"favorites\": \"10\",       \"impressions\": \"1023\",       \"retweets\": \"6\",       \"video_views\": \"0\"     },     \"1397568983931392004\": {       \"favorites\": \"268\",       \"impressions\": \"26803\",       \"retweets\": \"56\",       \"video_views\": \"17902\"     }   } }`  \nThe Media Views metric is only available for owned Tweets with the /28hour and /historical endpoints.\n",

You can include a maximum of 3 groupings per request. You can choose to group the metrics by one or more of the following values:  \n_All three endpoints support:_  \n* tweet.id\n* engagement.type  \n_The `/28hr` and `/historical` can provide time-series metrics, and thus support:_  \n* engagement.day\n* engagement.hour  \nGroupings are honored serially, so that you can change the desired result format by changing the order of your `group_by` values. Groupings that contain four `group_by` values will only be supported in one of the following two formats:  \n\"group_by\": [\n\"tweet.id\",\n\"engagement.type\",\n\"engagement.day\",\n\"engagement.hour\"\n]  \nOR  \n\"group_by\": [\n\"engagement.type\",\n\"tweet.id\",\n\"engagement.day\",\n\"engagement.hour\"\n]  \nFor example, if you want to generate grand totals of metric types, include the following \u201cgroupings\u201d specification as part of your request (and see the [API Reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement.html) page for more information on assembling requests):  \n{\n\"engagement_types\": [\n\"favorites\",\n\"replies\",\n\"retweets\"\n],\n\"groupings\": {\n\"Grand Totals\": {\n\"group_by\": [\n\"engagement.type\"\n]\n}\n}\n}  \nWith this grouping, the Engagement API\u2019s JSON response will include a root-level `\"Grand Totals\"` attribute which contains grand totals by metrics type:  \n{\n\"Grand Totals\": {\n\"favorites\": \"12\",\n\"replies\": \"2\",\n\"retweets\": \"2\"\n}\n}  \nTo generate a 4-hour time-series of metrics for a single Tweet grouped by Tweet IDs, the following Grouping specification would be part of the request:  \n{\n\"start\": \"2016-02-10T17:00:00Z\",\n\"end\": \"2016-02-10T21:00:00Z\",\n\"tweet_ids\": [\n\"697506383516729344\"\n],\n\"engagement_types\": [\n\"impressions\",\n\"engagements\"\n],\n\"groupings\": {\n\"Tweets_MetricType_TimeSeries\": {\n\"group_by\": [\n\"tweet.id\",\n\"engagement.type\",\n\"engagement.hour\"\n]\n}\n}\n}  \nWith this grouping, the Engagement API\u2019s JSON response will include a root-level `\"Tweets_MetricType_TimeSeries\"` attribute which contains the metrics broken down by Tweet ID, then metric type, and the corresponding hourly time-series:  \n{\n\"Tweets_MetricType_TimeSeries\": {\n\"697506383516729344\": {\n\"impressions\": {\n\"2016-02-10\": {\n\"17\": \"551\",\n\"18\": \"412\",\n\"19\": \"371\",\n\"20\": \"280\"\n}\n},\n\"engagements\": {\n\"2016-02-10\": {\n\"17\": \"8\",\n\"18\": \"6\",\n\"19\": \"3\",\n\"20\": \"0\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n}\n",

Why is this the case?**  \nThis is to be expected. The `engagements` metadata field may not always correlate with the sum of all individual engagement metrics returned by the API. This is because the `engagements` metadata field may include additional engagements that do not have specific metrics broken out in the payload. Said another way, adding all of the various engagement metric totals together may not equal the value you are seeing in the `engagements` metric field that is returned to you in the payload.  \nYou can think of the `engagements` metadata field as any click or interaction made on the Tweet.  \n**The `url_clicks` field in the payload response is returning a number, when in fact the Tweet does not have a URL. How is this possible?**  \nThis may be because a Tweet that contains something like a hashtag (that creates a link to another page) will count as a URL click if it is clicked on by a user.  \n**Why can I not receive engagement data for a specific Tweet?**  \nThere are various reasons why you might not be able to retrieve engagement data for a specific Tweet, including:  \n* The Tweet ID or IDs you have requested are not available based on the authentication token you are using to retrieve data on behalf of a third party.\n* The Tweet ID or IDs you have requested specific to the /totals endpoint are not 90 days or newer and are thus not available for returning the impressions or engagement metrics.\n* The Tweet ID or IDs you have requested are no longer available, usually indicating that they have been deleted or are no longer publicly available for another reason.  \nPlease review the different [error messages](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#ErrorMessages) that you will likely receive in any of the above cases.  \n**How can I handle rate limiting with the Engagement API?**  \nYou can use the `x-per-minute-limit` and `x-per-minute-remaining` information returned by the response header when you make a request to the Engagement API to monitor your consumption.  \n`x-per-minute-limit` tells you what your allowance is and `x-per-minute-remaining` tells you how many calls you have left.\n",

Most requests to the Engagement API require the use of 3-Legged OAuth (A specific version of User Context), meaning that you use the consumer key and secret of the app that has been registered and approved for Engagement API access by your Twitter account manager, as well as the Tweet owners' access token and access token secret to call the endpoint. The following requests require this type of OAuth:  \n* Any request to /totals to obtain Impressions and Engagements metric types, which are limited to owned Tweets\n* Any request to /28hr\n* Any request to /historical  \nSome requests to the Engagement API can be performed using Application-Only OAuth, meaning that you just need to provide your consumer key and secret, or a bearer token. The following request can be performed with this type of OAuth:  \n* Any request to /totals to obtain Favorites, Replies, Retweets, or Video Views metric types, which can be retrieved for any Tweet  \nFor any request, you will need to set up a Twitter app and corresponding API key using the app management console available at [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps).  \nPlease note - You can view and edit your existing [Twitter apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps) via the [Twitter app dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) if you are logged into your Twitter account on developer.twitter.com.  \nOnce you have set up your app, the app ID will need to be approved by your account representative in order for your app to make requests to the Engagement API. Access tokens must be used to represent the \u201ccurrent user\u201d, and requests made on behalf of a separate user must be signed with a valid token. Ensure that you\u2019re [encoding reserved characters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) appropriately within URLs and POST bodies before preparing OAuth signature base strings.  \nFor more information on how to get started with OAuth, please visit the following links:  \n* [OAuth Overview](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth.html)\n* [Using 3 Legged OAuth, also known as User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/3-legged-oauth)\n* [Using Application-Only OAuth](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only)\n",

Up to 250 Tweets may be included per request, and Tweet IDs must be represented as strings. |\n| **Engagement Types** | An array that includes the types of engagement metrics to be queried. The Totals endpoint supports only the following engagement types: `impressions`, `engagements`, `favorites`, `retweets`, `quote_tweets`, `replies`, `video_views`.  <br>The `/totals` endpoint supports the ability to retrieve `impressions` and `engagements` for Tweets created within the last 90 days, and `favorites`, `retweets`, `quote_tweets`, `replies`, and `video_views` for any Tweet. |\n| **Groupings** | Results from the Engagement API can be returned in different groups to best fit your needs. You can include a maximum of 3 groupings per request.  <br>  <br>For each grouping, you may define a custom grouping name to make it easier to refer to this grouping type in your application.  <br>  <br>Once you have defined a grouping name, you can choose to group `tweet.id` and/or `engagement.type`.  <br>  <br>Groupings are honored serially, so that you can change the desired result format by changing the order of your group\\_by values. An example grouping that will show metrics separated by Tweet ID and metric type looks like:  <br>  <br><br>  \"groupings\": {<br>      \"my grouping name\": {<br>        \"group\\_by\": \\[<br>          \"tweet.id\",<br>          \"engagement.type\"<br>        \\]<br>      }<br>    } |\n| **POST Size Limit** | Requests can be made for a maximum of 250 Tweet IDs at a time. |\n| **Response Format** | JSON.

Once you have defined a grouping name, you can choose to group by one or more of the following values:  <br>`tweet.id`  <br>`engagement.type`  <br>`engagement.day`  <br>`engagement.hour`  <br>Groupings are honored serially, so that you can change the desired result format by changing the order of your group\\_by values. An example grouping that will show metrics separated by Tweet ID, metric type, and looks like:<br><br>  \"groupings\": {<br>    \"my grouping name\": {<br>      \"group\\_by\": \\[<br>        \"tweet.id\",<br>        \"engagement.type\",<br>        \"engagement.day\"<br>      \\]<br>    }<br>  }<br><br>  <br>Groupings that have 4 `group_by` items are only valid if they use one of the following two orders. Requests that have 4 `group_by` items in a single grouping that are not one of the following will return an error. Additionally, only one grouping with 4 `group_by` items will be allowed per request.  <br><br>\"group\\_by\": \\[<br>    \"tweet.id\",<br>    \"engagement.type\",<br>    \"engagement.day\",<br>    \"engagement.hour\"<br>  \\]<br><br>\"group\\_by\": \\[<br>    \"engagement.type\",<br>    \"tweet.id\",<br>    \"engagement.day\",<br>    \"engagement.hour\"<br>  \\] |\n| **POST Size Limit** | Requests can be made for a maximum of 25 Tweet IDs at a time. |\n| **Response Format** | JSON. The header of your request should specify JSON format for the response. |\n| **Rate Limit** | You will be rate limited by minute, as specified in your contract according to your level of access. |\n| **Example Request** | curl -XPOST \"https://data-api.twitter.com/insights/engagement/historical\" <br>  -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' <br>  -H 'Authorization OAuth oauth\\_consumer\\_key=\"consumer-key-for-app\",oauth\\_nonce=\"generated-nonce\",oauth\\_signature=\"generated-signature\",oauth\\_signature\\_method=\"HMAC-SHA1\", oauth\\_timestamp=\"generated-timestamp\",oauth\\_token=\"access-token-for-authed-user\", oauth\\_version=\"1.0\"' <br>  -d '{<br>    \"start\": \"2015-08-01\",<br>    \"end\": \"2015-08-15\",<br>    \"tweet\\_ids\": \\[<br>       \"123456789\",<br>       \"223456789\",<br>       \"323456789\"<br>    \\],<br>      \"engagement\\_types\": \\[<br>        \"impressions\",<br>        \"engagements\",<br>        \"url\\_clicks\",<br>        \"detail\\_expands\"<br>    \\],<br>    \"groupings\": {<br>      \"types-by-tweet-id\": {<br>        \"group\\_by\": \\[<br>          \"tweet.id\",<br>          \"engagement.type\"<br>        \\]<br>      }<br>    }<br>  }' |\n| **Example Response** | {<br>    \"start\": \"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z\",<br>    \"end\": \"2015-08-15T00:00:00Z\",<br>    \"types-by-tweet-id\": {<br>      \"123456789\": {<br>        \"impressions\": \"0\",<br>        \"engagements\": \"0\",<br>        \"url\\_clicks\": \"0\",<br>        \"detail\\_expands\": \"0\"<br>      },<br>      \"223456789\": {<br>        \"impressions\": \"788\",<br>        \"engagements\": \"134\",<br>        \"url\\_clicks\": \"30\",<br>        \"detail\\_expands\": \"1323\"<br>      },<br>      \"323456789\": {<br>        \"impressions\": \"4\",<br>        \"engagements\": \"0\",<br>        \"url\\_clicks\": \"2\",<br>        \"detail\\_expands\": \"0\"<br>      }<br>    }<br>  } |\n| **Unavailable Tweet IDs** | For queries that include Tweet IDs that have been made unavailable (e.g., have been deleted), appropriate data will be returned for all available Tweet IDs, and unavailable Tweet IDs will be referenced in an array called `unavailable_tweet_ids`. For example:<br><br>{<br>    \"start\": \"2015-11-17T22:00:00Z\",<br>    \"end\": \"2015-11-19T02:27:50Z\",<br>    \"unavailable\\_tweet\\_ids\": \\[<br>        \"323456789\"<br>    \\],<br>    \"group1\": {<br>     \"423456789\": {<br>      \"favorites\": \"67\",<br>      \"replies\": \"8\",<br>      \"retweets\": 26<br>     }<br>    }<br>  } |\n",
