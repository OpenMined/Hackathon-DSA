This new tool\u00a0allows you to upload large datasets of Tweet or user IDs to retrieve their compliance status in order to determine what data requires action in order to bring your datasets into compliance.  \nIn addtion, both the batch compliance and the compliance firehose have been updated to support Tweet edits. For the compliance firehose, a new 'tweet\\_edit' event was added. See the\u00a0[Compliance Data Objects](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/compliance-firehose-api/guides/compliance-data-objects) documentation for more details.\u00a0Learn more about how Edit Tweet metadata works on the [Edit Tweets fundamentals](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/edit-tweets) page.\n",

This includes respecting their expectations and intent when they delete, modify, or edit the content they choose to share on Twitter. We believe that this is critically important to the long term health of one of the largest public, real-time information platforms in the world. Twitter puts controls in the hands of its users, giving individuals the ability to control their own Twitter experience. We believe that business consumers that receive Twitter data have a responsibility to honor the expectations and intent of end users.  \nFor more information on the types of compliance events that are possible on the Twitter platform, reference our article,\u00a0[Honoring User Intent on Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/compliance/guides/honoring-user-intent).  \nAny developer or company consuming Twitter data via an API holds an obligation to use all reasonable efforts to honor changes to user content. This obligation extends to user events such as deletions, modifications, and changes to sharing options (e.g., content becoming protected or withheld). This also includes when users edit their Tweets. Please reference the specific language in the\u00a0[Developer Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy.html)\u00a0and/or your Twitter Data Agreement to understand how this obligation affects your use of Twitter data.  \nTwitter offers the following solutions that deliver information about these user compliance events and whether a specific Tweet or User is publicly available or not. A brief overview of the solutions and their general integration patterns is detailed below:  \n#### GET statuses/lookup and GET users/lookup  \n* Format: REST API\u2019s See:\u00a0[GET statuses/lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/get-statuses-lookup.html)\u00a0and\u00a0[GET users/lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-lookup.html).\n* These endpoints always return the latest version of any Tweet edits.\u00a0All Tweet objects describing Tweets created after the edit feature was introduced will include Tweet edit metadata. This is true even for Tweets that were not edited.\n* For all Tweets, requests for Tweets more than 30 minutes after they were created will represent the final state of all Tweets.  \n* Deliver availability information for specific Tweets or Users as defined by the caller as part of the API request.\n* May be used for ad-hoc spot-checking on the current availability state of a specific group of Tweets / Users.\n* Ideal for customers who need a way to check the current state of a specific Tweet or User at a given moment in time.\n* These API\u2019s provide a helpful mechanism that may be used by customers who need to check the availability of a piece of Content, for instance when:\n1. Displaying Tweets\n2. Engaging with a Tweet(s) or User(s) in a 1:1 way\n3. Distributing Twitter Content to a 3rd party through an allowed file download\n4. Storing Tweets for extended periods of time  \n#### Compliance Firehose (enterprise only)  \n* Format: Streaming API See: [Compliance Firehose](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/compliance/api-reference.html).\n* Delivers realtime stream of [Compliance activities](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/compliance/guides/compliance-data-objects)\u00a0on Twitter. These activities include when Tweets are edited.\n* May be used to maintain compliance state across a set of stored data as new compliance events happen on the platform.\n* Ideal for customers consuming and storing large quantities of Twitter data for extended periods of time.\n",

Therefore, since all compliance messages are delivered only by numeric ID, it is important to design storage schemas that maintain the relationship between Tweet and User based on numeric IDs. Data consumers will need to monitor compliance events by both Tweet ID and User ID and be able to update the local data store appropriately.  \n* **Build Schemas That Address All Compliance Statuses**: Depending on how compliance activities will be addressed in various applications, it may be required to add other metadata to the data store. For instance, data consumers may decide to add metadata to an existing database to facilitate restricting the display of content in countries affected by a status\\_withheld message.  \n* **Handling Retweet Deletes**: Retweets are a special kind of Tweet where the original message is nested in an object within the Retweet. In this case, there are two Tweet IDs referenced in a Retweet \u2013 the ID for the Retweet, and the ID for the original message (included in the nested object). When an original message is deleted, a Tweet delete message is issued for the original ID. Tweet deletion events typically trigger delete events for all Retweets. However, in some cases not all are sent and client systems should be tolerant of incomplete Retweet deletions. The deletion of the original ID should be sufficient to delete all subsequent Retweets. It is a best practice to reference the original Tweet ID when storing Retweets, and deleting all referenced Retweets when receiving Tweet delete events.\n",

You will need to connect to all 8 partitions, each containing 12.5% of the total volume, to consume the full stream. |\n| **Compression** | Gzip. To connect to the stream using Gzip compression, simply send an Accept-Encoding header in the connection request. The header should look like the following:  <br>  <br>Accept-Encoding: gzip |\n| **Character Encoding** | UTF-8 |\n| **Response Format** | JSON. The header of your request should specify JSON format for the response. |\n| **Rate Limit** | 10 requests per 60 seconds. |\n| **Read Timeout** | Set a read timeout on your client, and ensure that it is set to a value beyond 30 seconds. |\n| **Support for Tweet edits** | All Tweet edits trigger a \"tweet\\_edit\" Compliance event. See the [Compliance Data Objects](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/compliance-firehose-api/guides/compliance-data-objects) documentation for more details. |  \n**Example Curl Request**  \nThe following example request is accomplished using cURL on the command line:  \ncurl --compressed -v -uexample@customer.com \"https://gnip-stream.twitter.com/stream/compliance/accounts/:account\\_name/publishers/twitter/:stream\\_label.json?partition=1\"  \n_Note:_ the above request is only connecting to `partition=1` of the Compliance firehose - you'll need to connect to all 8 partitions to consume the entirety of this stream.\n",

Therefore, since all compliance messages are delivered only by numeric ID, it is important to design storage schemas that maintain the relationship between Tweet and User based on numeric IDs. Data consumers will need to monitor compliance events by both Tweet ID and User ID and be able to update the local data store appropriately.  \n* **Build Schemas That Address All Compliance Statuses**: Depending on how compliance activities will be addressed in various applications, it may be required to add other metadata to the data store. For instance, data consumers may decide to add metadata to an existing database to facilitate restricting the display of content in countries affected by a status\\_withheld message.  \n* **Handling Retweet Deletes**: Retweets are a special kind of Tweet where the original message is nested in an object within the Retweet. In this case, there are two Tweet IDs referenced in a Retweet -- the ID for the Retweet, and the ID for the original message (included in the nested object). When an original message is deleted, a Tweet delete message is issued for the original ID. Subsequent delete messages are NOT issued for all of the Retweets. The deletion of the original ID should be sufficient to delete all subsequent Retweets.\n",
