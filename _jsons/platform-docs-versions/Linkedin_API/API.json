        "content": "Source document: ../data/platform-docs-versions/Linkedin_API/API.md\nParagraph location: \n\tAuthorization Code Flow (3-legged OAuth)\n\tStep 2: Request an Authorization Code\n\nContent: \n## Step 2: Request an Authorization Code  \nTo request an authorization code, you must direct the member's browser to LinkedIn's OAuth 2.0 authorization page, where the member either accepts or denies your application's permission request.  \nOnce the request is made, one of the following occurs:  \n1. If it is a first-time request, the permission request timed out, or was manually revoked by the member: the browser is redirected to LinkedIn's authorization consent window.  \n2. If there is an existing permission grant from the member: the authorization screen is bypassed and the member is immediately redirected to the URL provided in the `redirect_uri` query parameter.  \nWhen the member completes the authorization process, the browser is redirected to the URL provided in the `redirect_uri` query parameter.  \nNote  \nIf the `scope` permissions are changed in your app, your users must re-authenticate to ensure that they have explicitly granted your application all of the permissions that it is requesting on their behalf.  \nGET https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization  \n| Parameter | Type | Description | Required |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| response\\_type | string | The value of this field should always be: `code` | Yes |\n| client\\_id | string | The _API Key_ value generated when you registered your application. | Yes |\n| redirect\\_uri | url | The URI your users are sent back to after authorization. This value must match one of the _Redirect URLs_ defined in your [application configuration](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/). For example, `https://dev.example.com/auth/linkedin/callback`. | Yes |\n| state | string | A unique string value of your choice that is hard to guess. Used to prevent [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery). For example, `state=DCEeFWf45A53sdfKef424`. | No  |\n| scope | string | URL-encoded, space-delimited list of member permissions your application is requesting on behalf of the user. These must be explicitly requested. For example, `scope=liteprofile%20emailaddress%20w_member_social`. See [Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication) and [Best Practices for Application Development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/best-practices/application-development?context=linkedin/context) for additional information. | Yes |  \nThe scopes available to your app depend on which Products or Partner Programs your app has access to. This information is available in the [Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps). Your app's Auth tab will show current scopes available. You can apply for new Products under the Products tab. If approved, your app will have access to new scopes.  \n#### Sample Request  \nGET https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={your_callback_url}&state=foobar&scope=liteprofile%20emailaddress%20w_member_social  \nOnce redirected, the member is presented with LinkedIn's authentication screen. This identifies your application and outlines the particular member permissions/scopes that your application is requesting. You can change the logo and application name in the Developer Portal under My apps > [Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps)  \n#### Member Approves Request  \nBy providing valid LinkedIn credentials and clicking **Allow**, the member approves your application's request to access their member data and interact with LinkedIn on their behalf. This approval instructs LinkedIn to redirect the member to the redirect URL that you defined in your `redirect_uri`parameter.  \nhttps://dev.example.com/auth/linkedin/callback?state=foobar&code=AQTQmah11lalyH65DAIivsjsAQV5P-1VTVVebnLl_SCiyMXoIjDmJ4s6rO1VBGP5Hx2542KaR_eNawkrWiCiAGxIaV-TCK-mkxDISDak08tdaBzgUYfnTJL1fHRoDWCcC2L6LXBCR_z2XHzeWSuqTkR1_jO8CeV9E_WshsJBgE-PWElyvsmfuEXLQbCLfj8CHasuLafFpGb0glO4d7M  \nAttached to the `redirect_uri` are two important URL arguments that you need to read from the request:  \n* `code` \u2014 The OAuth 2.0 authorization code.\n* `state` \u2014 A value used to test for possible [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks.  \nThe `code` is a value that you exchange with LinkedIn for an OAuth 2.0 access token in the next step of the authentication process. For security reasons, the authorization code has a 30-minute lifespan and must be used immediately. If it expires, you must repeat all of the previous steps to request another authorization code.  \nWarning  \nBefore you use the authorization code, your application should ensure that the value returned in the `state` parameter matches the `state` value from your original authorization code request. This ensures that you are dealing with the real member and not a malicious script. If the state values do not match, you are likely the victim of a [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attack and your application should return a `401 Unauthorized` error code in response.  \n#### Failed Requests  \nIf the member chooses to cancel, or the request fails for any reason, the client is redirected to your `redirect_uri` with the following additional query parameters appended:  \n* `error` - A code indicating one of these errors:\n* `user_cancelled_login` - The member declined to log in to their LinkedIn account.\n* `user_cancelled_authorize` - The member refused to authorize the permissions request from your application.\n* `error_description` - A URL-encoded textual description that summarizes the error.\n* `state` - A value passed by your application to prevent [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks.  \nFor more error details, refer [here](#oauthv2authorization)\n",

This value must be kept secure as specified in the [API Terms of Use](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/api-terms-of-use). The length of access tokens is ~500 characters. We recommend that you plan for your application to handle tokens with length of at least 1000 characters to accommodate any future expansion plans. This applies to both access tokens and refresh tokens. |\n| expires\\_in | int | The number of seconds remaining until the token expires. Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60-day lifespan. |\n| refresh\\_token | string | Your refresh token for the application. This token must be kept secure. |\n| refresh\\_token\\_expires\\_in | int | The number of seconds remaining until the refresh token expires.

You can go through the OAuth flow on multiple clients (browsers or devices) and simultaneously hold multiple valid access tokens if the same scope is requested. If you request a different scope than the previously granted scope, all the previous access tokens are invalidated.\n",

To refresh an access token, go through the [authorization process](#step-2-request-an-authorization-code) again to fetch a new token. This time however, in the refresh workflow, the authorization screen is bypassed, and the member is redirected to your redirect URL, provided the following conditions are met:  \n* The member is still logged into [www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/)\n* The member's current access token has not expired  \nIf the member is no longer logged in to [www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/) or their access token has expired, they are sent through the normal [authorization process](#step-2-request-an-authorization-code).  \nProgrammatic refresh tokens are available for a limited set of partners.

By default, access tokens are valid for 60 days and programmatic refresh tokens are valid for a year. The member must reauthorize your application when refresh tokens expire.  \nWhen you use a refresh token to generate a new access token, the lifespan or Time To Live (TTL) of the refresh token remains the same as specified in the initial OAuth flow (365 days), and the new access token has a new TTL of 60 days.  \nFor example, on:  \n* Day 1 - Your refresh token has a TTL of 365 days, and your access token has a TTL of 60 days.\n* Day 59 - If you generate a new access token using the refresh token, the access token will have a TTL of 60 days and the refresh token will have a TTL of 306 days (365-59=306).\n* Day 360- If you generate a new access token, your access token and refresh token will both expire in 5 days (365-360=5) and you must get your application reauthorized by the member using the authorization flow.  \nNote  \nRefresh Tokens are useful in minting new Access tokens and allow for seamless operations for extended periods of time. However, LinkedIn reserves the right to revoke Refresh Tokens or Access Tokens at any time due to technical or policy reasons. In such scenarios, the expectation from products leveraging Refresh Tokens is to fallback to the standard OAuth flow, and present the login screen to the end users.\n",

If you don't need certain fields, you can decrease response time and payload size by using a projection to ask only for the fields your application is interested in.  \nBy default, services may not always return all of the information that your application requests.\u00a0In these cases, you'll need to use a projection to retrieve any non-default fields.  \nField projections are defined using the `&fields=` query parameter and narrowed by providing a comma-separated list of field names that you want returned as the value of the parameter.  \nIn the following example, a service returns these types of objects:  \n#### Sample Objects  \n{\n\"id\" : int,      <- Default projection field\n\"foo\": string,   <- Default projection field\n\"bar\": boolean,\n\"baz\": Object\n}  \nA GET call to retrieve one of these objects provides the following response:  \nGET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/sampleService/42  \n#### Sample Response  \n{\n\"foo\": \"Zing!\",\n\"id\": 42\n}  \nNotice how the `bar` and `baz` fields were not returned in the response. This is because they are not part of the service's default field projection.  \nIf you want to get `id`, `bar`, and `baz` back in the response (but not `foo`, because it's irrelevant to your application), use a field projection:  \nGET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/sampleService/42?fields=id,bar,baz  \n#### Sample Response  \n{\n\"bar\": true,\n\"baz\": {\n\"beep\": \"Yay!\",\n\"bloop\": \"Meh\",\n\"blorp\": \"Boo!\"\n},\n\"id\": 42\n}\n",

Add the X-HTTP-Method-Override header using the original HTTP method `-H 'X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST'` for POSTs or `-H 'X-HTTP-Method-Override: PUT'` for PUTs.  \ncurl -X POST https://api.linkedin.com/v2/adCreativesV2?ids=List(47770196) \\\n-H 'X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST' \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer redacted' \\\n-H 'X-RestLi-Method: BATCH_PARTIAL_UPDATE' \\\n-H 'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0' \\\n--data ${\"entities\": {{\"47770196\": {\"patch\": {\"$set\": {\"status\": \"ACTIVE\"}}}}}}'  \n3. Add the Content-Type header `-H 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=xyz'`.  \ncurl -X POST https://api.linkedin.com/v2/adCreativesV2?ids=List(47770196) \\\n-H 'X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=xyz' \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer redacted' \\\n-H 'X-RestLi-Method: BATCH_PARTIAL_UPDATE' \\\n-H 'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0' \\\n--data ${\"entities\": {{\"47770196\": {\"patch\": {\"$set\": {\"status\": \"ACTIVE\"}}}}}}'  \n4.

Rate limits specify the maximum number of API calls that can be made in a 24 hour period. These limits reset at midnight [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) every day.  \nThere are two kinds of limits that affect your application:  \n* **Application** \u2014 The total number of calls that your application can make in a day.\n* **Member** \u2014 The total number of calls that a single member per application can make in a day.  \nNote  \nThe term `Member` refers to a LinkedIn user whose token is used to initiate API calls from the developer application. For example, a partner is responsible for managing multiple members. This member-level designation indicates the permissible number of API calls the partner can initiate from their application on behalf of a member token.  \nRate limited requests will receive a 429 response. In rare cases, LinkedIn may also return a 429 response as part of infrastructure protection. API service will return to normal automatically.  \nYour application's daily rate limit varies based on which API endpoint you are using. Standard rate limits are not published in documentation. You can look up the rate limit of any endpoint your app has access to through the [Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps). Select your app from the list and navigate to its Analytics tab. This page will only show usage and rate limits for endpoints you have made at least 1 request to today(UTC). If you want to look up a rate limit for an endpoint not listed in your app's Analytics page, make 1 test call to that endpoint and refresh the Analytics page.\n",

Please refer the [Recent Changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/recent-changes) page for information on the specific API versions that are affected by this deprecation.  \nWhen you call an API, the response may contain [URNs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/urns?context=linkedin/context) referencing the different types of objects provided by LinkedIn's services. These URNs are valuable on their own; however, there may be instances when you want to expand a URN and access the values associated with the entity.  \nDecoration is a mechanism in LinkedIn's APIs to fetch data belonging to a URN object without having to make an extra call to that object's API. Decoration uses a syntax very similar to LinkedIn's [Field Projections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/projections?context=linkedin/context).  \nSee the following example of a service that returns URN references to another type of entity:  \n#### Sample Request  \nGET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/{service}/1234  \n#### Sample Response  \n{\n\"id\": 1234,\n\"relatedEntity\": \"urn:li:relatedEntity:6789\"\n}  \nRather than taking the `relatedEntity` URN value and making a second GET call to its parent service, you can use decoration to define how you'd like the `relatedEntity` object to be expanded within the original API request.\u00a0To do this, append the `~` character to the\u00a0entity you wish to expand, and then provide the field projection in parentheses afterwards. For example:  \n#### Sample Request  \nGET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/{service}/1234&projection=(id,relatedEntity~($URN,foo,bar))  \n#### Sample Response  \n{\n\"id\": 1234,\n\"relatedEntity\": {\n\"$URN\": \"urn:li:relatedEntity:6789\",\n\"bar\": \"bloop\",\n\"foo\": \"bleep\"\n}\n}\n",

Before initiating the validation flow, LinkedIn will generate a string that will act as the `challengeCode`.\n2. LinkedIn will use the `challengeCode` as a query parameter to make an HTTP GET to your webhook endpoint.

Your application must compute the challengeResponse (Hex-encoded HMACSHA256 signature for the challengeCode) using its clientSecret as the secret key. If you received an applicationId query parameter in the previous step, use the clientSecret associated with the challenged application. Return both the challengeCode and challengeResponse in a JSON payload with a 200 OK status within 3 seconds. See the example below. The response should have header \"content-type\" value set to \"application/json\".  \nchallengeResponse = Hex-encoded(HMACSHA256(challengeCode, clientSecret))  \n{\n\"challengeCode\" : \"890e4665-4dfe-4ab1-b689-ed553bceeed0\",\n\"challengeResponse\" : \"27b1d19678542072a7f1d0ce845d0c78cec22567f413697e25648f44fa3d1514\"\n}  \n4. On receiving the validation response, LinkedIn will verify by computing the challenge response and comparing it with the `challengeResponse` returned by the app.\n5. If the `challengeResponse` is successfully verified, then the webhook is ready to be used in subscriptions.

Each of those Rest.li methods would have its own standard request and response interfaces.  \nThe Rest.li protocol also supports complex resource keys and query parameters, and it has a custom protocol for encoding them.  \nNearly all of LinkedIn's APIs are built on the Rest.li framework with additional LinkedIn-specific details, which results in a robust yet complex protocol that can be challenging to implement correctly.\n",

For a NodeJS application using an HTTP client library like [axios](https://axios-http.com/), there are quite a few details to get right to perform a working request, as shown in the following sample code: base URL, resource prefix, auth and custom headers, and correct encoding of complex query parameters. The result can be difficult to write and maintain and doesn\u2019t account for edge cases requiring query tunneling.  \nconst axios = require('axios');  \nconst ACCESS_TOKEN = \"AQX5\u2026\";\nconst API_VERSION = '202302';  \n// Define a generic function to search ad accounts by references\nfunction searchForAdAccountsByReferences(\nreferences,\ncount = 10,\nsortField = 'ID',\nsortOrder = 'ASCENDING'\n) {\nreturn axios.request({\nbaseURL: 'https://api.linkedin.com',\nurl: '/rest/adAccounts',\nmethod: 'get',\nheaders: {\n'Authorization': `Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}`,\n'X-RestLi-Method': 'finder',\n'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version': '2.0.0',\n'Connection': 'Keep-Alive',\n'LinkedIn-Version': API_VERSION\n},\nparams: {\nq: 'search',\nsearch: `(reference:(values:List(${references.map(encodeURIComponent).join(',')})))`,\ncount,\nsort: `(field:${sortField},order:${sortOrder})`\n},\nparamsSerializer: {\n// Can't use default encoding\nencode: (val) => val\n}\n}).then(response => response.data.elements);\n}  \n// Search for ad accounts by a list of organizations, with up to 20 results\nconst orgs = ['urn:li:organization:123', 'urn:li:organization:456'];\nsearchForAdAccountsByReferences(orgs, 20).then(adAccounts => {\nconsole.log(adAccounts);\n});  \nCompare that to this code utilizing the LinkedIn API client. The client abstracts much of the complexities of constructing the request. It allows passing in objects, arrays, and strings with special characters as is, making the code easy to write and maintain. Furthermore, it handles edge cases where query tunneling may be required.  \nconst { RestliClient } = require('linkedin-api-client');  \nconst restliClient = new RestliClient();\nconst ACCESS_TOKEN = \"AQX5...\";\nconst API_VERSION = '202302';  \n// Define a generic function to search ad accounts by references\nfunction searchForAdAccountsByReferences(\nreferences,\ncount = 10,\nsortField = 'ID',\nsortOrder = 'ASCENDING'\n) {\nreturn restliClient.finder({\nresourcePath: '/adAccounts',\nfinderName: 'search',\nqueryParams: {\nsearch: {\nreference: {\nvalues: references\n},\n},\ncount,\nsort: {\nfield: sortField,\norder: sortOrder\n}\n},\nversionString: API_VERSION,\naccessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN\n}).then(response => response.data.elements);\n}  \n// Search for ad accounts by a list of organizations, with up to 20 results\nconst orgs = ['urn:li:organization:123', 'urn:li:organization:456'];\nsearchForAdAccountsByReferences(orgs, 20).then(adAccounts => {\nconsole.log(adAccounts);\n});  \nIn summary, using these API clients can speed up and simplify the development process and make your application code maintainable and robust.

Educate your users to look for signs to ensure they are entering credentials for a real LinkedIn application. Note that browsers may look different, and this may not always be enough to differentiate a legitimate site from a phishing site. Alert members not to enter credentials when in doubt and to contact you when they suspect suspicious activity.  \nLinkedIn has a DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server Certificate (padlock) that can be viewed prior to the URL in the browser. The base URL hostname is always \"[https://www.linkedin.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/)...\". Beware of URLs that try to mimic LinkedIn by using common misspellings or swapping similar characters such as \"1\" (one) for \"l\" (letter 'L'), e.g., \"l1inkedIn.com/\", or \"linked1n.com/\".\n",

The following are a few examples of changes we consider breaking:  \n* Changes to existing permission definitions\n* Removal of an allowed parameter, request field or response field\n* Addition of a required parameter or request field without default values\n* Changes to the intended functionality of an endpoint. _For example, if a DELETE request previously used to archive the resource but now hard deletes the resource._\n* Introduction of a new validation  \nA **non-breaking change** is a change that you can adapt to at your own discretion and pace without disruption. In most cases, we will communicate non-breaking changes after they are already made. Ensure that your application is designed to be able to handle the following types of non-breaking changes without prior notice from LinkedIn:  \n* Addition of new endpoints\n* Addition of new methods to existing endpoints\n* Addition of new fields in the following scenarios:\n* New fields in responses\n* New optional request fields or parameters\n* New required request fields that have default values\n* Addition of a new value returned for an existing text field\n* Changes to the order of fields returned within a response\n* Addition of an optional request header\n* Removal of redundant request header\n* Changes to the length of data returned within a field\n* Changes to the overall response size\n* Changes to error messages. _We do not recommend parsing error messages to perform business logic. Instead, you should only rely on HTTP response codes and error codes._\n* Fixes to HTTP response codes and error codes from incorrect code to correct code\n",
