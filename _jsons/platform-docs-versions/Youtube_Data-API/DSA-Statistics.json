The lists below identify the different types of resources that you can retrieve using the API. The API also supports methods to insert, update, or delete many of these resources.  \nThis reference guide explains how to use the API to perform all of these operations. The guide is organized by resource type. A resource represents a type of item that comprises part of the YouTube experience, such as a video, a playlist, or a subscription. For each resource type, the guide lists one or more data representations, and resources are represented as JSON objects. The guide also lists one or more supported methods (`LIST`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.) for each resource type and explains how to use those methods in your application.\n",

Every request must either specify an API key (with the `key` parameter) or provide an OAuth\u00a02.0 token. Your API key is available in the [Developer Console's](https://console.developers.google.com/) **API Access** pane for your project.  \n2. You **must** send an authorization token for every insert, update, and delete request. You must also send an authorization token for any request that retrieves the authenticated user's private data.  \nIn addition, some API methods for retrieving resources may support parameters that require authorization or may contain additional metadata when requests are authorized. For example, a request to retrieve a user's uploaded videos may also contain private videos if the request is authorized by that specific user.  \n3. The API supports the OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol. You can provide an OAuth\u00a02.0 token in either of the following ways:  \n* Use the `access_token` query parameter like this: `?access_token=``oauth2-token`\n* Use the HTTP `Authorization` header like this: `Authorization: Bearer` `oauth2-token`  \nComplete instructions for implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication in your application can be found in the [authentication guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/authentication).\n",

Please note the following characteristics of thumbnail images:  \n* A resource's `snippet.thumbnails` property is an object that identifies the thumbnail images available for that resource.\n* A `thumbnail` resource contains a series of objects. The name of each object (`default`, `medium`, `high`, etc.) refers to the thumbnail image size.\n* Different types of resources may support different thumbnail image sizes.\n* Different types of resources may define different sizes for thumbnail images with the same name. For example, the `default` thumbnail image for a `video` resource is typically 120px by 90px, and the `default` thumbnail image for a `channel` resource is typically 88px by 88px.\n* Resources of the same type may still have different thumbnail image sizes for certain images depending on the resolution of the original image or content uploaded to YouTube. For example, an HD video may support higher resolution thumbnails than non-HD videos.\n* Each object that contains information about a thumbnail image size has a `width` property and a `height` property. However, the width and height properties may not be returned for that image.\n* If an uploaded thumbnail image does not match the required dimensions, the image is resized to match the correct size without changing its aspect ratio. The image is not cropped, but may include black bars so that the size is correct.  \nFor more information about this resource, see its [resource representation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/thumbnails#resource) and list of [properties](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/thumbnails#properties).  \n| Method | HTTP request | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| URIs relative to `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3` |     |     |\n| `[set](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/thumbnails/set)` | `POST\u00a0/thumbnails/set` | Uploads a custom video thumbnail to YouTube and sets it for a video. |\n",
