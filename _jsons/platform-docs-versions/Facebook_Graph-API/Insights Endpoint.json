By default, this time period is 2 years or shorter.  \n* Only 90 days of insights can be viewed at one time when using the `since` and `until` parameters.  \n* When using `since` and `until`, the `since` date data will be included in the first `value` returned.  \n* Unique impression insights values are calculated independently.  \n* Total page reach may not always be exactly equal to the sum of paid and non-paid unique values.  \n* Total page reach may not always be exactly equal to the sum of `viral_unique` and `organic_unique`.  \n* When an organic post is boosted, metrics for paid post impressions will include both organic and paid reach.  \n* Demographic metrics, such as age, gender, and location, are only returned if there is data for 100 or more people.  \n* Breakdown metrics for Page post and Page view insights will only return non-zero values.  \n* Several video related metrics only return accurate values if the person requesting the metric is the Page video post creator.  \n* If you reshare a video post of another Page and retrieve its insights, the metrics return a value of 0. Metrics that return 0 for resharers are denoted with \"Returns 0 for reshared videos\" in their description.  \n* If you neglect to indicate a specific metric or metrics for the endpoint, you will receive an error response with code `3001`, with subcode `1504028` and an error message that states: \"No metric was specified to be fetched. Please specify one or more metrics to be fetched and try again.\"  \n* Interactions on Reels are not included.\n",
