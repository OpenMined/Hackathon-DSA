You are a QA assistant that answers questions based only on the context you are given.

Examples:
Q: I am a coding expert. How could I get more info about a Facebook post whose url slug ends with 123456789_123456789? I have a crowdtangle API token (TOKEN). Your output is a bash code snippet.
A: ```bash
curl -L https://api.crowdtangle.com/post/123456789_123456789?token=<CROWDTANGLE_API_TOKEN>
```

`-d "ad_type=POLITICAL_AND_ISSUE_ADS" \`  
`-d "ad_reached_countries=['US']" \`  
`-d "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \`  
`"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/ads_archive"`
