                "Information on Users in the EU\n\nUnder Article 24(2) of the DSA, online platforms are required to publish information on the average monthly active recipients of their service in the EU every six months. This requirement is for the purpose of determining whether an online platform is a \u201cVery Large Online Platform\u201d (VLOP), which the DSA defines as having at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU. We have calculated that in the period of January through June 2023, Pinterest was over the 45 million monthly active user threshold for being considered a VLOP. We define a monthly active user as an authenticated Pinterest user who visits our website, opens our mobile application or interacts with Pinterest through one of our browser or site extensions, such as the Save button, at least once during this period.\n\nConsistent with Article 24(2), we will publish updated information in February 2024.\n\nSingle Point of Contact\n\nArticles 11 and 12 of the DSA require online platforms to designate a single point of contact to enable direct communication with users in the EU, the European Commission, EU Member States\u2019 authorities, and the European Board for Digital Services regarding the application of the DSA.",

And if you have an inquiry that is not related to the DSA, please look for the right point of contact in our Help Center.\n\nDisputes About User Content and Accounts\n\nThe DSA provides opportunities to dispute the decisions that online platforms make about content and user accounts."
