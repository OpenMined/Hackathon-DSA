LinkedIn's v2 REST APIs contain a number of concepts that help apply standard RESTful principles at scale, model data consistently, and ultimately provide a well-structured end-to-end developer experience.

```
host: api.linkedin.com
basePath: /v2
scheme: https
```

Note

The `/V2` basePath is used for *most* LinkedIn API calls.  
The *authentication procedure* uses host: `www.linkedin.com`
