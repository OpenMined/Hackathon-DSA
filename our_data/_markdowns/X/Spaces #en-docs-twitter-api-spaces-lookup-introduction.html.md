Introduction

Introduction
------------

The Spaces lookup endpoints help you lookup live or scheduled Spaces, and enable you to build discovery experiences to give your users ways to find Spaces they may be interested in.

The lookup by ID endpoints return data you can use to build experiences to display Spaces information to your users, or return details about one or more Spaces. You can lookup one or more Spaces in the same request.

You can also lookup Spaces by their creator ID. This endpoint is useful to lookup Spaces from users in a list, or to determine if multiple recurring hosts are live now or have an upcoming Space scheduled. Up to 100 users can be looked up in a single request.

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved developer account.
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a developer App that is located within a Project.
