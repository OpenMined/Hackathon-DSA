Tweet caps

Twitter API v2 has a Tweet consumption cap that limits the number of Tweets that you can receive from a set of endpoints on a monthly basis. Tweet caps apply at the Project-level, meaning that any requests to the endpoints listed below using the keys and tokens from developer Apps within that Project will count towards the Project Tweet cap.   

### Limited v2 endpoints

Tweets you receive from any of the following endpoints count towards this monthly Tweet cap:

* Tweets Lookup
* Recent search
* Full-archive search
* Filtered stream
* User Tweet timeline
* User mention timeline
* Likes lookup - Tweets liked by a user
* List Tweets lookup

### Note:

If the same Tweet is returned from multiple queries during the billing cycle, then the Tweet is only counted once against the monthly cap - i.e, the Tweets are deduplicated.

**Dedupe** Counter gets reset on a monthly basis  (at the end of the billing cycle).

### Tweet cap volumes

The Tweet cap volume depends on your access level:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Free** tier | 1,500 Tweets per month |
| **Basic** tier | 10,000 Tweets per month |
| **Pro** tier | 1,000,000 Tweets per month |
| **Enterprise** tier | 50+ million Tweets per month |

You can check your usage towards the monthly Tweet cap by viewing the main dashboard page in the developer portal. Under the name of your Project, you'll see a status bar that illustrates your current month’s usage in relation to the Tweet cap. You will also see the number of Tweets you pulled this month, the percentage of Tweets used in relation to the cap, and the date your Tweet cap usage resets.
