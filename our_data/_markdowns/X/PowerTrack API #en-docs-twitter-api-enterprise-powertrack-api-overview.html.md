Enterprise

*This is an enterprise API available within our managed access levels only. To use this API, you must first set up an account with our enterprise sales team.¬†Learn more*  

*You can view all of the Twitter API filtered stream offerings¬†HERE.*

The PowerTrack API provides customers with the ability to filter the full Twitter firehose, and only receive the data that they or their customers are interested in. This is accomplished by applying the PowerTrack filtering language - see Rules and filtering - to match Tweets based on a wide variety of attributes, including user attributes, geo-location, language, and many others. Using PowerTrack rules to filter Tweet ensures that customers receive all of the data, and¬†*only*¬†the data they need for your app.  

### Core components

The PowerTrack API consists of two endpoints:

#### Rules endpoint

A separate endpoint managed independently by your application, the rules endpoint supports GET, POST,¬†POST \_method=delete¬†and rule validation methods with basic authentication for managing your ruleset. It can support thousands of rules that allow you to filter the realtime stream of data for the topics and conversations that you care about. The rules endpoint can be accessed, managed, and will persist regardless of your connection status to the stream - you can also update (add/remove) rules while connected to the stream and the changes will take effect almost immediately.

#### Stream endpoint

Connecting to the streaming endpoint consists of a simple GET request using basic authentication. Once a connection is established, data is delivered in JSON format (see sample payload below) through a persistent HTTP Streaming connection. You will only receive data matching your rules while connected to the stream.

#### Rule tags

A single PowerTrack stream can support thousands of rules, so being able to discern which rule(s) matched a given Tweet becomes important. This is easily solved by using rule tags. Upon rule creation, you can assign a tag value which will be returned in the matching\_rules¬†object (see here)¬†of the response payload.

Rule tags can represent an end customer use case, a topic or conversation, or another helpful identifier that you can use to route incoming Tweets accordingly.

If, in addition to realtime data, your product also requires instant access to recent data, we recommend using our¬†Search API.
