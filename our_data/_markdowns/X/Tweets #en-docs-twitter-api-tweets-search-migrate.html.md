Comparing Twitter API‚Äôs Search Tweets endpoints
-----------------------------------------------

The v2 Search Tweets endpoint will eventually replace the standard v1.1 search/tweets¬†endpoint¬†and enterprise Search API. If you have code, apps, or tools that use an older version of a Twitter search endpoint and are considering migrating to the newer Twitter API v2 endpoints, then this guide is for you.¬†

This page contains three comparison tables:

* Recent search
* Full-archive search
* Filtering operator comparison

### Filtering operator comparison

The four different versions (standard, enterprise, and v2) of search Tweets differ in which operators are available, and also have varying levels of operator availability within each version, which are explained below.¬†

Enterprise

* There are no sub-tiers of enterprise operators

Twitter API v2

* **Free:**Available when using any Project
* **Basic:** Available when using any Project
* **Pro:** Available when using a Project
* **Enterprise:** Available when using a Project

You can learn more about each of these sets of operators in their respective guides:

* Enterprise operators
* Twitter API v2 operators

Now that we understand the different operator levels within Twitter API v2, here is the table that maps out operator availability for search Tweets (note that if the cell is left blank, the operator is not available):
