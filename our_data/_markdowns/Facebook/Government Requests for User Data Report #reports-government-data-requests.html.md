 Government Requests for User Data
===================================

 As part of our ongoing effort to share more information about the requests we have received from governments around the world, Meta regularly produces this report on government requests for user data to provide information on the nature and extent of these requests and the strict policies and processes we have in place to handle them.

 Global Overview
-----------------

 Meta responds to government requests for data in accordance with applicable law and our terms of service. Each and every request we receive is carefully reviewed for legal sufficiency and we may reject or require greater specificity on requests that appear overly broad or vague. This chart provides data on the number of requests we received and the rate we complied with all or some of the government's request for each half by country or region. We publish this information in 6-month increments, subject to certain limitations, and we began reporting this information in 2013.
