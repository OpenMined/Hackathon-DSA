### Graph API Root Nodes
This is a full list of the Graph API root nodes. The main difference between a root node and a non-root node is that root nodes can be queried directly, while non-root nodes can be queried via root nodes or edges. If you want to learn how to use the Graph API, read our Using Graph API guide, and if you want to know which APIs can solve some frequent issues, try our Common Scenarios guide.
