Comments
========

Represents a collection of IG Comments on an IG Media object.

### Non-Organic Comments

Comments on Ads containing IG Media (i.e. non-organic comments) are of a different type and are not supported. To get non-organic comments, use the Marketing API and request the Ad's `effective_instagram_story_id`. You can then query the returned ID's `/comments` edge to get a collection of non-organic Instagram Comments. Refer to the Marketing API's Post Moderation guide for more information.
