ThreatExchange
==============

Most threat-intelligence solutions suffer because the data is too hard to standardize and verify. Meta created the ThreatExchange platform so that participating organizations can share threat data using a convenient, structured, and easy-to-use API that provides privacy controls to enable sharing with only desired groups.
