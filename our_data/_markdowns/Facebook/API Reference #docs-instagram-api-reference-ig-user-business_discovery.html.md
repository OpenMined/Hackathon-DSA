**`GET /{ig-user-id}?fields=business_discovery.username({username})`**

Returns data about another Instagram Business or Creator IG User. Perform this request on the Instagram Business or Creator IG User who is making the query, and identify the targeted business with the `username` parameter.

### Limitations

Data about age-gated Instagram Business IG Users will not be returned.

### Query String Parameters

* `{username}` (required) â€” The username of the Instagram Business or Creator IG User you want to get data about.

### Permissions

A Facebook User access token with the following permissions:

* `instagram_basic`
* `instagram_manage_insights`
* `pages_read_engagement` or `pages_show_list`

If the token is from a User whose **Page role was granted via the Business Manager**, one of the following permissions is also required:

* `ads_management`
* `pages_read_engagement`
* `business_management`

### Field Expansion

You can use field expansion get public fields on the targeted IG User. Refer to the IG User reference for a list of public fields.

### Sample Request with Field Expansion

Getting data about the Instagram Business IG User "Blue Bottle Coffee" and using field expansion to request its followers and media counts.

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){followers_count,media_count}
```
### Sample Response

```
{
  "business_discovery": {
    "followers_count": 267788,
    "media_count": 1205,
    "id": "17841401441775531"
  },
  "id": "17841405309211844"
}
```
### Accessing Edges with Field Expansion

You can also use field expansion to access the `/media` edge on the targeted IG User and specify the fields and metrics that should be returned for each IG Media object. Refer to the Media node reference for a list of public fields.

**v10.0 and older calls until September 7, 2021:** The `like_count` field on an IG Media will return `0` if the media owner has hidden like counts on it.

**v11.0+ calls, and all versions on September 7, 2021:** If indirectly querying an IG Media through another endpoint or field expansion, the `like_count` field will be omitted from API responses if the media owner has hidden like counts on it. Directly querying the IG Media (which can only be done by the IG Media owner) will return the actual like count, however, even if like counts have been hidden.

### Sample Request with Edge

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){followers_count,media_count,media}
```
### Sample Response with Edge

```
{
  "business_discovery": {
    "followers_count": 267788,
    "media_count": 1205,
    "media": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "17858843269216389"
        },
        {
          "id": "17894036119131554"
        },
        {
          "id": "17894449363137701"
        },
        {
          "id": "17844278716241265"
        },
        {
          "id": "17911489846004508"
        }
      ],
    },
    "id": "17841401441775531"
  },
  "id": "17841405309211844"
}
```
### Pagination

The `/media` edge supports cursor-based pagination, so when accessing it via field expansion, the response will include `before` and `after` cursors if the response contains multiple pages of data. Unlike standard cursor-based pagination, however, the response will not include `previous` or `next` fields, so you will have to use the `before` and `after` cursors to construct `previous` and `next` query strings manually in order to page through the returned data set.

### Sample Request

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){media{comments_count,like_count}}
```
### Sample Response

  "business_discovery": {
