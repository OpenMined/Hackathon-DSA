This document refers to an outdated version of Graph API.Â Please use the latest version.Graph API Versionv18.0`/{object-id}/comments`
=======================
This reference describes the `/comments` edge that is common to multiple Graph API nodes. The structure and operations are the same for each node. The following objects have a `/comments` edge:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * Album
* Comment
* Event
* Link
 | * Live Video
* Photo
* Post
 | * Thread
* User
* Video
 |
It is possible for comment objects to have a `/comments` edge, which is called *comment replies*. The structure is the same for these, but attention should be paid to the modifiers for these edges.
Reading
-------
Returns a comment on an object.

The `id` field for the `/PAGEPOST-ID/comments` endpoint will no longer be returned for apps using the Page Public Content Access feature. To access the comment IDs for a Page post you must be able to perform the MODERATE task on the Page being queried. This change is in effect for v11.0+ and will be implement for all versions on September, 7, 2021.
###  New Page Experience
The following objects `/comments` endpoint are supported for New Page Experience:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| * Album
* Comment
* Link
* Page
 | * PagePost
* Photo
* Post
* PostComment
 |
### Permissions
* The same permissions required to view the parent object are required to view comments on that object.

### Limitations
* Other users' profile information and comments will not be returned when accessing user posts, photos, albums, videos, likes, and reactions unless authorized by those users.
* Comments returned in a query are based on default filtering. To get all comments that can be returned depending on your permissions, set the `filter` parameter to `stream` or use the `order` field.
* A new Page can comment as the Page on new Pages or classic Pages. However, a classic Page can not comment on a new Page.
* For the following nodes, the `/comments` endpoint returns empty data if you read it with a User access token:
	+ Album
	+ Photo
	+ Post
	+ Video
* The `id` field for the `/PAGEPOST-ID/comments` endpoint will no longer be returned for apps using the Page Public Content Access feature. To access the comment IDs for a Page post you must be able to perform the MODERATE task on the Page being queried.
* For objects that have tens of thousands of comments, you may encounter limits while paging. Learn more about paging in our Using the Graph API Guide.

  Parameter  |  Description  || `summary`
*bool* | A summary of metadata about the comments on the object. Importantly this metadata includes `order` which indicates how the comments are being sorted. |
| `filter`
*enum { toplevel, stream }* | If a person can reply to a comment, you can filter comments based on top level comments, comments that are made directly on the post, or the chronological order of all comments.* `toplevel` - This is the default. It returns all top-level comments in chronological order, as ordered on Facebook. This filter is useful for displaying comments in the same structure as they appear on Facebook.
* `stream` - All-level comments in `chronological` order. This filter is useful for comment moderation tools where it is helpful to see a chronological list of all comments.
 |
### Fields
An array of Comment objects in addition to the following fields when `summary` is `true` in the request.

  Field  |  Description  || `order`
*enum { chronological, reverse\_chronological }* | Order in which comments were returned.* `chronological`: Comments sorted by the oldest comments first.
* `reverse_chronological`: Comments sorted by the newest comments first.
 |
| `total_count`
*int32* | The count of comments on this node. It is important to note that this value changes depending on the `filter` being used (where comment replies are available):* if `filter` is `stream` then `total_count` will be a count of all comments (including replies) on the node.
* if `filter` is `toplevel` then `total_count` will be a count of all top-level comments on the node.
Note: `total_count` can be greater than or equal to the actual number of comments returned due to comment privacy or deletion. |
Publishing
----------
Publish new comments to any object.

###  New Page Experience
The following objects `/comments` endpoint are supported for New Page Experience:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| * Comments
* PagePosts
* Photo
* Post
 | * PostComment
* Video
 |
### Permissions
* A Page access token requested by a person who can perform the `MODERATE` task on the Page
* The `pages_manage_engagement` permission
Note, the `can_comment` field on individual comment objects indicates whether it is possible to reply to that comment.
