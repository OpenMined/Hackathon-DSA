This document refers to an outdated version of Graph API.Â Please use the latest version.Graph API Versionv18.0`/{object-id}/likes`
====================
This reference describes the `/likes` edge that is common to multiple Graph API nodes. The structure and operations are the same for each node. The following objects have a `/likes` edge:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| * Album
* Comment
* Page
* Photo
* User
* Video
 |  |
Reading
-------

Returns the list of people who liked this object. When reading likes on a Page or User object, this endpoint returns a list of pages liked by that Page or User.

Use the `likes` field of an object to get the number of likes.

We recommended that you use the `/object/reactions` endpoint to get like counts, if available.

### New Page Experience

The following objects `/likes` endpoint are supported for New Page Experience:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| * Album
* Comment
* Photo
* PagePost
 | * User
 |
### Requirements
* The same requirements required to view the object are required to view likes on that object.

### Limitations
* Only aggregated counts using `total_count` with the `summary` parameter are available for Post likes.
* The `like` reaction counts include both "like" and "care" reactions.
* `total_count` represents the approximate number of likes, however, the actual number returned might be different depending on privacy settings.
* The `GET /{group-post-id}/likes` and `GET /{post-id}/likes` endpoints are deprecated in v8.0+ and deprecated in all versions on Nov. 2, 2020.
