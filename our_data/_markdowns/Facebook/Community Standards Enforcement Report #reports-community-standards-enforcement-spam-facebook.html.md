====
We do not allow spam on Facebook. Spam is a broad term used to describe content that is designed to be shared in deceptive and annoying ways or attempts to mislead users to drive engagement. Spam spreads in a number of ways: It can be automated (published by bots or scripts) or coordinated (when an actor uses multiple accounts to spread deceptive content).
Spammers aim to build audiences to inflate their content's distribution and reach, typically for financial gain. The tactics spammers use, and our ability to detect them, drive the amount of content we take action on as well as our proactive rate.

Content Actioned on Spam
------------------------
Content actioned decreased from 1.1 billion in Q2 2023 to 413 million in Q3 2023, due to a decrease in enforcement due to a bug in our proactive detection technology that was later fixed in August. Fluctuations in enforcement metrics for spam are expected due to the highly adversarial nature of this space.

Proactive rate increased from 95.3% in Q2 2023 to 98.2% in Q3 2023, due to an update in our calculation to the proactive rate.

Restored content decreased from 129 million in Q2 2023 to 16.5 million in Q3 2023, due to updates to our proactive detection technology to improve accuracy.
prevalence
----------
How prevalent were spam violations?

 We cannot estimate this metric right now. We are working on new methods to measure the prevalence of spam on Facebook. Our existing methods for measuring prevalence, which rely on people to manually review samples of content, do not fully capture this type of highly adversarial violation, which includes deceptive behavior as well as content. Spammy behavior cannot always be detected by reviewing the content alone. We are working on ways to review and classify spammers' behavior to build a comprehensive picture.

How we calculate itProactive rate is the number of pieces of content acted on that we found and actioned before people using Facebook reported them, divided by the total number of pieces of content we took action on.Read about this dataCorrecting mistakesPeople can appeal our decisions, unless there are extreme safety concerns. We restore content we incorrectly removed or when circumstances change. Restores can happen from appeals or when we identify issues ourselves.

How we calculate itRestored content is the number of pieces of content that we restored during the reporting period after previously actioning it. We restore content both when it is appealed and when we discover issues ourselves.Read about this dataNOTE:Due to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of COVID-19, we could not always offer people the option to appeal. We still gave people the option to tell us they disagreed with our decision, which helped us review many of these instances and restore content when appropriate. Starting in Q2 2022, we updated our methodology for how we count appeals to include all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including after people told us that they disagreed with our decision.
