================================
We restrict the display of adult nudity and sexual activity on Facebook and Instagram. We make some exceptions when it is clear the content is being shared in the context of a protest, for educational or medical reasons or a similar reason. On the other hand, we default to removing sexual imagery to prevent non-consensual or underage content from being shared.
This report does not include metrics related to our separate policy on the promotion of sexual assault, violence or exploitation.

How we calculate itRestored content is the number of pieces of content that we restored during the reporting period after previously actioning it. We restore content both when it is appealed and when we discover issues ourselves.Read about this dataNOTE:Due to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of COVID-19, we could not always offer people the option to appeal. We still gave people the option to tell us they disagreed with our decision, which helped us review many of these instances and restore content when appropriate. Starting in Q2 2022, we updated our methodology for how we count appeals to include all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including after people told us that they disagreed with our decision.
